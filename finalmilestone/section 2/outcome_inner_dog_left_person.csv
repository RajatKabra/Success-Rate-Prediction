She did very well with our son and his family's visit over the Holidays which included a little puppy who liked to antagonize Secret and then jump up on the couch where she knew Secret would not go. By the end of the visit, the 2 of them would cuddle up in the same comfy bed on the floor and sleep: so cute!! Secret does have that issue of not wanting me to put the socks on her paws. She actually would run away from me and hide behind my husband's chair at one point. She now will let me touch her feet, but I'm proceeding very slowly in this. Secret likes to ""lead"" when I walk both Manny and her together, which leads me to believe she'd do a great job at leading a blind person. We are enjoying our time with Secret very much. She is a sweetheart and is a wonderful companion! ",478,Primary,17611,0,22,1S413,Secret,2014-02-17 17:16:48,"We have raised 2 GEB puppies before: Yani, who came to us in July2007 and had her graduation Aug 15, 2009. We also raised Manny who passed his IFT but was released while in training. We adopted him on 11/10/2011. He will be 4 yrs old in June. He is now a therapy dog and I will be taking him to regular visits that are usually no longer than 1 hour.   I work part time (usually 1 day/week) at ""Central Hospital for Veterinary Medicine"" (4 Devine St, North Haven, CT 06473) as a Tech Assistant. I have spoken with my supervisor and she said I could put a crate in the Dr's office where there is no contact with sick patients, although there might be occasionally a Dr's pet in that room. I will request not to take care of contagious patients while the puppy is at work with me. I always change out of my scrubs before coming home after work. I just found out that another puppy raiser from our region is interested in puppysitting our new pup on the days I'll be working! So I won't need to bring the pup to work after all! When the puppy is old enough to stay in the crate for several hours, I will leave the puppy home and my husband will take the puppy and Manny out once while I'm at work (he already does this for Manny now).   I volunteer at the Middle School Library 2 mornings/ week and at the Food Pantry on Sat mornings and babysit for our church's Moms' group one morning/week. I am also very involved with my church and participate in several weekly groups. I will put any of my activities on hold until the puppy is able to be in the crate for longer periods or as the puppy gets used to new exposures, I hope to include the pup in my activities with me.   We live in a house with a fairly large back yard which is not fenced in. We let Manny out on a long (50ft) leash and play with him there.   Manny and I walk to a friend's house (where there is a fenced-in back yard) several mornings/ week and another friend and her dog join us there too. The 3 dogs play for a while then Manny and I walk home;It's about 1 mile each way. I am hoping to bring the new pup with us on these outings. Of course he/she won't be able to walk the mile each way at the beginning, so we'll need to drive. Bur as the pup gets older I'm hoping to do this.   Our neighborhood is quiet, but there are quite busy streets very close by. My husband and Manny and I like to  take long walks every day and part of the walk is along the busy street, so Manny is very used to traffic. We would be including the new pup on the walks as he/she is able.   Our older son will be getting married out of State in June, so we will be needing a puppysitter for a few weeks then.  We usually drive out to Chicago once or twice/ year to visit family. We have in the past brought the GEB pups we were raising with us on these trips and hope to do this again with the new pup.  Manny loves other dogs and is very gentle and submissive. He would be a great ""big brother"" to a little pup, I think. Hopefully he will only teach his good manners :)!"

Oh, and yes, Whitney is spayed.  During the summer, when the pup will arrive, I will be working 3 days during the week, and Karissa will be home during the day to help with training of the pup. Ryan will be in and out at varied times and will be helpful as well. Tom works in Hartford daily and will be available to help with training, especially house manners. :)  We live in a rural neighborhood, our back yard is fenced in, we have a one-level ranch home so out to ""get busy"" will be easy (as easy as it can be with a young pup! but will improve as the pup grows). We have a good area to walk around the neighborhood (tho' no sidewalks in our immediate neighborhood). We are active people and will be able to give the pup lots of exercise and exposure to lots of experiences. we can bring the pup to the beach walk, walking trails, shopping areas, work, the hospital, all in time as the pup develops and is ready for these experiences.  by the time school starts, we still would not need to have the pup in the crate more than 5 hours maximum since we are all staggered in when we arrive home.   We will be returning from our family vacation June 28th, so anytime in July would work out fine to start our new adventure as puppy raisers!"

(That's me). I will be the primary caretaker and trainer, since I will be the one who is with the pup the majority of  the time; however, we will all be responsible for training and caring for the puppy. The girls are involved in several extracurricular activities, which will also be a way to introduce the puppy to new social situations. And while we are a busy family, like many, we also spend a fair amount of time at home or close to home. We have two other animals, both caged: a guinea pigs and a rabbit.    We live in a village setting, where there are many opportunities for walking and socialization (including with people and other dogs).   Please let us know if we can provide other details.

We do travel in the summer, usually a week or 2, & a few camping trips.  We have a trailer & the camp grounds we stay at are dog friendly, I'd like to bring the pup with us.

He remains a ""build up"" pup- and needs support when he makes a poor choice- or might have a tendency to shut down. I enjoy him immensely (probably because he is a much different temperament than many I have raised- so he keeps me thinking :) ) (One other note- on his pupsits- the sitters report he takes some time to settle into their homes and completely relax; however- when playing pass the pup or switching handlers on outings- he will cheerfully work with whoever is showering him with affection) :) ",,,,,26,,,,

We also have a male golden retriever (who will turn 10 in February, but is still very active at this point), who is very friendly with other dogs, including pups.    Probably the most important thing schedule-wise is that we have a place in Pennsylvania (near Ligonier) where we go for numerous weekends, particularly in the summer. We also usually are there for 1 or 2 full weeks. I'm hoping that there is a facility in that area (perhaps Greensburg, Latrobe or Johnstown) where we could occasionally attend class with the pup this summer. If not, we will need to schedule our trips accordingly, and may need another raiser to help once or twice."

",430,Primary,26622,0,9,6V14,Vern,2014-04-01 00:13:02,"My husband and I live on Cape Cod and have three children and one dog.  I have been a stay at home Mom for the past 23 years.  My husband owns a business with his partner and they repair european automobiles.  They have done well and grown over the past 19 years.  Our three children are in college.  The two oldest will graduate in May and our youngest will be a sophomore this fall. Three years ago my Mom relocated to the Cape from Pennsylvania.  She was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer eight years ago.  She started needing a little help and wanted to be closer to me.  You never would have known she had cancer, she managed to live without the horrible consequences cancer can sometimes bring.  However, this past September she passed away.  Her batteries simply ran out.  She did however live out her life with her positive spirit, happy personality, dignity and simply never gave into her illness.   The last four months of her life she stayed in our home, again you never would have know she had anything wrong, she was a pleasure to have around.  She loved the company of the children, my husband, me and our dog.  So, I have gone from being a mom, attending countless swim meets for 17 years and then being responsible for my Mom's well being to having time I never had before.  My mothering will never end, however the day to day responsibilities are now different.  I have countless projects that are finally getting done and although I am busy I have time I haven't had before.    Being able to give my mother the comfort of being at home during the end of her life gives me great peace.  All she wanted was to be at home with family, I am thankful we were able to do that.  She loved her independence and ability to keep it as long as she could.  I think of the blind person wanting the same thing.  I would like nothing more than to help in a dogs journey to becoming that independence for someone.      Let me briefly tell you about our dog Ollie.  He is a well exercised (I try and walk 5-6 miles each day), 8 year old, 100 pound English lab.  He is nothing less than part of our family.  He has a dog bed in every room that the family may gather.  His job in life has been loving his family.  If he is leaning on your foot he is content.  Everyone in the family is responsible for Ollie's well being. We bring Ollie wherever and wherever we can.  We are what I call very responsible dog owners.      I do believe at this time in my life I have the opportunity to give something back.  My time is free and my discipline and dedication is unmeasured.  I am a goal setter, I have run many a marathon with two goals, do better than the last time and finish.  My goal with a pup of course would have one goal, graduate to helping a blind person.        I don't know what I can say to help with the match of a pup in our home.  I believe Ollie will be welcoming as he is with meeting most dogs but perhaps a male is better than a female just to keep the peace.  We are here to help and hope you will consider us for pup placement.     Carol Cavanaugh"

Hubby leaves around 6:15 and I leave at 7:00 a.m.  We do not have children. We have three older cats (two at apprx 10 and one at 16).  They have been around dogs in their past.  We had two corgis. The last one crossed Rainbow Bridge in Nov 2013. They liked to chase the cats.  We let them chase one because she made this a game.  However, we know that the puppy dog will not be allowed to do this. And, we completely understand.  And, we have a neighbor golden retriever visit our house at least 5 out of the 7 days. She visits for about 10 minutes and then goes home.  Usually in the afternoon, evening.    My work, Avon Dixon Insurance, has said it is ok if the puppy dog comes to work with me.  So most days the puppy dog will be with me.  It is a calm office with about 35 people in it, mostly women.  My daily life there is a lot of sitting at the desk. However, I am up a lot to the printer, the kitchen, meetings in other offices, board rooms.  I work from 7:30 to apprx 4:30.  At lunch, I sometimes go out to get food.  Sometimes I bring lunch with me.  Sometimes, I do errands at lunch.  Would the puppy dog be able to stay in his crate at work during this one hour?    My work is in the town of Easton MD – so after work and sometimes at lunch I can walk him on the sidewalks  and near shops in town.  There is great small town exposures where I work.    My husband works as a caretaker.  The puppy dog will not be going to work with him.  However, we could take him there and introduce him to a farm.  If that is what you want us to do.  They have sheep, chickens, horses.  Hubby is also a contractor with tools……  We can introduce loud noises with tools to the puppy dog.     I am usually home Mon – Fri around 5:30 same for hubby.   Sometimes we do errands after work, together.  Sometimes, we go over to visit my parents.  We love to take walks after we are home from work.  We do not have sidewalks where we live.  As we live out in the country where there are only roads and grass.  We walk about 2.5 miles when we go.  You will have to let us know if the puppy dog can go with us or not since there are no sidewalks.   Although , it is great exercise for him.  We also live across from a River. I am assuming he cannot swim in it.  Our neighbor has a pool where her dogs swim, can ours swim too??    Our back yard is fenced in, therefore, he can go off lead in the yard.      On weekends, we wake about 7:00 a.m.  Weekends are really flexible.  No set schedule.  We have lots of options with what will be expected of us to do with puppy dog.  Our grandnephew (two  yrs old in July) visits my parents at least twice a month on weekends.  We can expose the puppy to him.  Just let us know if there is anything the puppy should not do while he is around children.     We do travel to Colrain Massachusetts at least once a quarter. Hubby’s dad is there as well as his sister’s family.  We usually drive.  They also live in the country with no sidewalks.  They are close to a town where we can walk him.  Then at least once a year we fly to Cape Coral Florida to visit my brother’s family.  We may be able to take the puppy dog at least once during his stay with us.    Hubby and I are pretty much laid back about life.  Not high strung. We do not have arguments between us.  Our house is calm and serene.  This is how we like to keep our life.  Our house is definitely our serene home."

Also once a week, my mother comes over and we have a girl’s dinner in my apartment. I’m anticipating adding once a week puppy classes to my schedule as well.    As for weekends, I usually volunteer for Habitat for Humanity on Saturdays from about 8am-3pm. On Sundays, I have family dinners around 5:30pm with my mother and stepfather. Other than those two activities, my weekends do not have any regular structured activities.    I’m thinking a new schedule might look something like this:  6:30	  Wake Up  6:30-6:40	  Get busy/Stretch time  6:40-6:45	  Scarf down breakfast (Food bowl manners)  6:45-6:50	  Get busy #2  6:50-7:20	  Human breakfast and dress time, puppy teaching time  7:20-7:35	  Play time  7:35-7:45	  Quick walk  7:45-8:00	  Travel to Gym  8:00-9:00	  Personal Training/Workout  9:00-9:15	  Travel home  9:15-9:40	  Human getting ready time, puppy teaching time  9:40-9:45	  Get busy  10:00	  Work  2:00-2:30	  Lunch break, get busy, play time, get busy  6:00-10:30	  Get busy, play, teach, cuddle, play, teach, cuddle.    There really aren’t any activities I have where the puppy will not be allowed to join. For the weekly bill-pay nights, the neighbor’s house is empty as she is with her husband in Florida as he is undergoing rehab. She has given permission for the puppy to stay with me in the house, which will be much desired company in the evenings there! None of my friends or family are allergic or otherwise opposed to dogs and therefore will be a welcomed addition for any guests I have at my apartment.    As for the weekends, as long as approved by Guiding Eyes, I believe the dog is welcome on building sites. The puppy will also be welcome to come with me to Sunday night dinners.     My best friend is a school teacher and therefore finishes her work day around 3pm and then picks up her four year old daughter, both of whom love dogs and have two of their own. I have discussed this endeavor with them and my best friend said they may be able to occasionally stop by and visit with the puppy in the late afternoons before I get home. My mother is retired and often comes to Salisbury for meetings and errands, she may also be able to stop in and show the puppy some love every once in a while. I live on the same property as the couple I rent from and the husband is starting retirement. I anticipate he will be available if any extreme emergencies arise where I am unable to get home at the necessary time.    The apartment I’m living in is a studio apartment which is just enough room for one single person. While there isn’t a tremendous amount of space in the apartment, the property I’m on is very large, safe, and quiet. It will be the perfect place to play with the puppy and allow him or her to romp around under supervision. Since I live alone, many evenings can feel lonely and I’m very excited to be able to have time and energy at this point in my life to be able to devote myself to a puppy who will grow up to become an extremely helpful friend for someone in need."

Yet as a teenage boy, he can be goofy and silly, but none of that obnoxious male behavior such as mounting, marking, bullying, etc.  He does experience yellow zone arousal when entering a new environment, when encountering new dogs and when encountering highly aroused dogs in class.   After repeating small sliced exposures, he will quickly returns to green zone.  And then is able to move forward in a calmer demeanor without the need of repeating as many small slices.  In cases such as these, he has been very consistent in demonstrating the same results in his ability from going to yellow to green.  Nice and predictable!  Work in progress for red zone with nail clipping.  Green zone for body handling of the head/neck and body/tail regions and legs.  Great strides have been made in his progress of not picking up non-dog items.  Does a great job with knowing ™outš.   Has never destroyed or ingested items, just likes to pick them up and carry it around.    As a youngster, Mickey had the tendency to yield space, becoming goofy in his body movements .  He has progressed to become comfortable in the green zone when physically manipulating his body into position ž such as when doing the various vet holds.  But still occasionally, enters yellow zone with gentle restraint.  Good results with the work in progress to do shorter snap shots of gentle restraint while his body is relaxed.  Overall, Mickey is well behaved and appears to be confident in all areas of his training and socialization.  My husband says he is his favorite so far, but he says that about every dog!

We are currently looking to purchase a house and it is possible we will be living in a house in Fishkill within the next few months. Mark is an engineer for the power company and works consistently M-F from the hours of 7:30-4:30 in Newburgh, NY approximately 20 minutes from home. Mark can come home for lunch on certain days, (usually 1 or 2 per week) depending on meetings and other variables. Amanda has just finished her summer job and is looking for part or full-time employment close to home.     When Mark gets home from work, we will generally do something active together such as hiking, running road biking, or going to the gym. On the weekends, we generally exercise in the morning, do some household chores, shopping, etc. Some weekends we will drive up to the Catskills to do a longer hike. We generally cook dinner every night, going out to restaurants only occasionally. Afterwords we generally watch TV.     We occasionally go away for weekend trips, and our favorite place to go is Lake Placid. When we go there, we walk around town, go skiing, hiking, biking and running, and hang out at the local restaurants, many of which are dog friendly. (Ever hear of Ubu the dog? He is a staple for the area.)      We have a cockatiel named Henry who is very friendly and likes to chirp when the sun comes up. Sometimes we allow him to walk around the condo as long as we can keep an eye on where he is. Otherwise he is generally very happy just climbing around his cage and sitting on a perch. We clip his flight feathers regularly so he doesn't try to fly and hurt himself since he is very clumsy and would otherwise fly into things. He has lived with dogs before and is not fazed by them."

We have family visitors from California stay with us 4-5 times a year. The house is active & busy on the weekends with kids, neighbors & friends coming for play & family dinners. The kids play soccer on the weekends and Kevin coaches the team. We will have lots of time to walk the puppy daily and bring them to appropriate socialization activities.    Currently, we have no pets. The kids have taken care of several neighborhood cats and love it. We are all excited to raise a puppy and volunteer for Guiding Eyes. Years ago, Kevin & I lived in San Francisco and fostered a breeder, Cozy, from Guide Dogs in San Rafael. Kevin's mother and siblings are currently fostering breeders for Guide Dogs and our kids love being with the dogs when we visit San Francisco.    We enjoyed the foster experience so much we decided to volunteer with Guiding Eyes and give our children the experience of helping to raise a puppy. We attended a graduation last Spring & a puppy training class this Spring. We are ready to learn & get involved!    ~Sheree McNulty"

I work 10 minutes away from my home at PepsiCo in Somers, NY.  I do get an hour lunch break which I generally take to work out but other people take for lunch and errands outside of the office.  Currently I am in the P3 program between PepsiCo and Guiding Eyes where we can socialize GE puppies at the office.  I would have to get approval to bring in older GE pups but I feel based on the ambassadors and management’s knowledge and experience with this program that it could happen that I could bring the pup with me to work on certain days.  I am at a desk most of the time and occasionally have meetings that are not on a consistent schedule that could be moved around or taken over the phone so I feel like I’m in a position now it would allow me to have the flexibility to leave my desk to take the pup out to get busy or exercise.       On the weekends I stay within the area doing errands or hanging out with friends or boyfriend who is 10 mins away as well.  I like to spend my free time with my 5 year old dog going on walks around the block or park or taking her to the dog park if the weather is nice.      I live at home currently with my Mother and Father and we have 1 acre property but our yard is not fenced in.  My mom is retired and cannot drive for the next few years so she stays at home with our 2 dogs (5 and 15 years old) or sometimes goes to work with my Dad (maybe two times a month), so she is available to be with the pup or take him/her out and play too.  My dad works about 35 mins away and even when he is home he is on his computer working.  Sometimes my parents will take walks together but they take it easy most weekends just going to the store of working on things around the house so they stay home most weekends.    I feel overall we are all in a good position in my household to provide guidance, support, training and attention to GE pups."

When the puppy arrives I will be able to devote most of my day to his/her needs.  We are in a residential neighborhood, half of the households on the block have young children and dogs, our yard is fenced on three sides.  My husband travels a fair amount for work and I join him on some of the trips but we have deferred any new trips until after the puppy is six months old.  But as a result weekends are usually low key involving exercise, yard work and dinners with friends.  We have two sons, one who is a sophmore in college and who will not be home much except for Thanksgiving and Christmas and a second who is a senior in high school.  In the spring during sports season, our schedule changes and afternoons and evenings are busier with practice and games.  By that time the puppy will be six months old and able to be alone for longer periods, though I don't think I should ever need to leave him/her for more than 2-3 hours at a time."

Ana Holloway      I wake up at around 10AM in the morning. I tend to sleep in most mornings.   I go to college at Northern Virginia Community College where i am getting a degree in Diagnostic Medical Sonography.   If i have an early morning class i make sure to wake up extra early and have everything ready to go.   Usually I will grab a coffee or something to eat at the school's cafe.  My classes may run either one and a half hours to three hours in duration on a weekly schedule once a week or twice a week.  My husband and I currently share our car, so after class i usually take a bus home or get  a ride home. When I finally get home it is time for lunch. Generally my husband will have just arrived home from working at Mt Vernon Animal Hospital. After grabbing a bite to eat for lunch we will be working on some homework from our classes.     I currently work two separate jobs on a part time schedule. Two days a week I will work as a server at the Silver Leaf Restaurant  located in the Ballston Holiday Inn from 4:30 to 10 pm at night. Wednesdays I work at the Clarendon Grill as a hostess from 5 to 10 pm. Both of my jobs are extremely flexible with my hours and days I work. Whenever I am at work my husband is always at home since he works in the mornings only. Once I get home from work I relax for a while, watch a little television, or work on some homework. I am a night owl so I generally don't go to bed until late at night, unless I've had a long day at work.     For the passed two months now on Thursday or Friday night I babysit my neighbors children. Their eldest child gets out of preschool around 3:15 pm which is around the time I arrive at their home. I then stay there until around 6 pm when their mother comes home from work. There are some times where I may stay anywhere to an hour late depending if their mother runs into heavy traffic on her way home. My duties and responsibilities for taking care of the children is to play with them, give them their dinner, and with the weather permitting taking them out for either a long walk or to the local playground.      When it comes to the weekends I usually stay at home with my husband, make plans to go into DC, or go somewhere nearby. On Saturday afternoon I go with my husband to work at the Animal hospital. There we clean the pets that are boarding at the facility. Take each one outside for a walk ,depending on their conditions.   Give any medication that is needed to the pets. Feed the animals, some with special food.   Saturday evenings or Sunday evenings is usually family dinner night. Its a time to regroup and catch up with   all the family members that live with in the area. This is usually done at my mothers house or aunts house in Arlington."

We are concerned about his ability to self modulate and regain focus in stessfull situations.  His good days are good, but his bad days usually require us to ""take him out of the game.""  We've seen some improvement in his ability to play with other dogs in structured play, but it does take due diligence on the handlers part to keep the play going in a positive direction.  We are still seeing alot of pestering behavior with dogs not interested in playing with him, i.e. he just can't take no for an answer.  An outing today at WalMart went well, but it did require use of body blocking to refocus his attention on his handler.  Did well with people going by but items on shelves were more distracting.",,,,,26,,,,

I am a stay at home mom of three girls 10,12 and 13yrs. We are in walking distance to school so I often walk the youngest to school and pick her up at the end of the day. I generally work out in the morning after the girls have gone to school and love to walk around the hilly bronxville streets. I love to walk to the store or into town, not so keen on driving. We have an apartment on a lake in Connecticut that we spend a lot of time at in the summer. This is a community that caters for and allows dogs. Also during the summer we like to take a trip to Europe to visit family, both my husband and myself are from England but have lived in the states for 15yrs. We do love to travel and like to make the most of the girls school vacation time. At the moment however we have nothing booked for thanksgiving, or Christmas, just have family visiting us. We are however planning to go away for Presidents week and Easter.  I am a qualified Dentist but I am unable to work in the states. When we first moved to the states I worked at the anti cruelty society in Chicago, generally cleaning animals ear, nail clipping and the odd tooth extraction. This I loved but had to give up when I became pregnant because of the risk of toxoplasmosis.  I also volunteered at a vets in England throughout high school with the hopes of studying veterinary surgery, which alas did not happen. I had a dog growing up and then cats when I was at college, I have a lot of time and patience for animals. The girls adore animals and we feel they are old enough now to be responsible and realize that raising a puppy although great fun is also hard work."

I have also talked to my vet and she is happy to sponsor our guiding eye dog, she has helped us with fosters in the past."

In May through summer months we travel/are away from home a great deal, so as we get started on puppy raising we felt we could only commit to being a ""Starter Puppy Raiser"", October until sometime in April. We live in a house with a fenced back yard (6 foot wood fence), so that provide a safe play area.  We have a very mellow 8 year old yellow lab named Lillie. She gets along very well with other dogs. We anticipate being able to spend a solid amount of time daily with the pup for all the various activities. Having said that, we are overdue on doing some misc stuff on our house such as wall paper removal and painting, etc. So we will probably allocate some 2 hour blocks of time in a daily basis where the pup will be in the crate while I and my husband, Bruce do some painting/home do it yourself work. Both of us are fairly physically fit. However, I have some lower back issues where I cannot lift more than 20 pounds. (I will not be able to lift a big puppy into the car so my husband will need to do that.)     We really feel very comfortable that this an excellent fit for us, as much as being a starter puppy raiser can be. Of course we are new to the STEP training process, so are learning as we go.    Although we have 3 sons, all are grown and 2 live about 20 minutes away (may be stopping by some). They love puppies so are really interested in the upcoming puppy, but they do have busy lives of their own."

I will start going back to Church, now that I have the time, so when the puppy is ready, that will also be an option for him (Our Pastors are great and allowed Etna to go with us when she was in training).

I do household stuff on the weekends, my husband works a lot so I have a lot of free time for exposure trips, etc.  We live in a neighborhood, right by the High School, Park, Library, Recreation Center, shopping plaza and we have sidewalks and would be able to walk a short distance to many exposures."

Basic commands can be slow when she is distracted but we are working on her being more consistent.  She seems to do well with wearing things and being handled.  She is willing to work with fellow raisers in class but keeps a close eye on me.  I feel like we are at a plateau so I could use some suggestions to get us over the hump.  She plays well with other dogs and is doing much better with our cats (persuing has greatly decreased).,,,,,26,,,,

The afternoon schedule varies during the weekdays depending on the kids' activities. We let the dogs out/take them on walks as we come and go. Sometimes the dogs, one by one or all of them, come with me to the barn. I like to take walks in the woods there.  The weekend schedule varies. We sleep in a little bit, go to the barn, take hikes, work around the house, soccer games.  I hope this helped. I realized that my schedule is difficult to pinpoint since I'm lucky enough not to have to be at work certain times. It also depends on if Rick is home working or traveling. He makes sure the dogs get to go out regularly during the day. I hope this helps."

Sometimes the dogs, one by one or all of them, come with me to the barn. I like to take walks in the woods there.  The weekend schedule varies. We sleep in a little bit, go to the barn, take hikes, work around the house, soccer games.  I hope this helped. I realized that my schedule is difficult to pinpoint since I'm lucky enough not to have to be at work certain times. It also depends on if Rick is home working or traveling. He makes sure the dogs get to go out regularly during the day. I hope this helps."

My new role as the regional efile administrator is part-time, very seasonal in nature and allows me to do 95% of my work remotely from home.  My heaviest work cycles are from February 15th through April 15th and from September 1st through October 15.  The rest of the year I work varying hours.  I would consider my schedule to be extremely flexible.    My daily schedule right now during “busy season” consists of working for several hours on the computer in the morning then treadmill or the gym for an hour then back to work.  I try not to work more than 2 hours without taking at least a 20 minute break.  Appointments and errands are usually worked in during the afternoons.  Current daily working hours are about 10 to 12 hours per day.  I work in the office one day a week and typically that day is only about 3 to 5 hours.  Evenings are usually pretty quiet and spent on wind down activities like cooking and reading.    I work most weekends during busy season but make time for major household chores and DIY projects around the house.  I enjoy gardening and in the good weather months I like walking in area parks and at the nearby lake.  I also enjoy playing tourist and visiting the various exhibits and museums in DC.    This will be my first summer on my new schedule and I feel like I will have virtually tons of free time.  There will be weeks that I only work 1 to 2 hours a day and some weeks when I do not work at all.  I look forward to exploring several volunteer opportunities after April 15th.  I am applying to become a CASA volunteer (Court Appointed Special Advocate for abused or neglected children) in Fairfax County.  This will involve occasional court appearances and regular visits to clients and health care professionals (typically only 1 to 2 hours per week).  I also hope to sign up for Meals on Wheels and for projects with Habitat for Humanity.  And last, but not least, I would welcome the opportunity to become a puppy raiser/sitter for Guiding Eyes for the Blind."

Over the past few weeks we have worked at stopping the biting and I do see an improvement, but we still need to work on it. The counter surfing is also still a problem.  Flossie seems curious about what is on the counter - usually there is no food out. She just jumps up to look. Mostly she like to drink water out of the kitchen sink despite having a full bowl of fresh water available to her on the floor. Flossie truly enjoys working on her behaviors. She learns quickly and enjoys working, but she can be stubborn. She gets annoyed when asked to go place or down. Often she stands her ground and will not go place or down, she just barks at her handler and won't move. We have been keeping Flossie on leash inside the house to help prevent counter surfing and to stop her from biting.",733,Primary,16933,0,26,4F13,Flossie,2013-03-18 00:32:02,"We live in a house with a big backyard and our street is a 1 mile loop.

I do leave in the afternoons for an hour or two to shop or if I have an appointment. My husband is active outdoors, we take rides in the car on the weekends. I am very flexible as far as my sleep schedule goes. I am healthy, but I am a smaller woman, so I wonder if a girl dog would be an easier size to manage?  Not sure about that, though!  I will be the primary raiser, but my husband John is onboard and will be a great help. I am looking forward to the structure and activity surrounding raising a puppy. Thanks for the opportunity.

Still most of the time it still takes him 2 or 3 times to eliminate all the way. This however does not impact going on an outing/into stores. Young knows to hold it.,,,,,26,,,,

Its just me and my husband but we live in a very dog centric neighborhood and I have lots of friends who can't wait fo rme to get a puppy to raise.  We had to put our Charlotte (Bearded Collie X) down two years ago so this pup would be an only child.  We travel by car quite a bit but always took Charlotte with us (she's on more than one B&B web site) so we are used to finding dog friendly places.      In general:    Monday is house cleaning day so no issues there.    Tuesdays I'm a docent at a museum in the afternoons.  Until pup is old enough to be alone for 5 hours or so, I'd either do a short shift or take them with me & crate them in a spare office while I give tours.    Wednesdays I am at my parish & pup can come with me.  (Charlotte always did).    Thursdays I'm a docent at a different museum so the same deal as Tuesdays.    Fridays are errand & laundry day.  Not hard to work out my schedule to accomodate puppy.    Weekends are pretty quiet.  Dinner with friends (who are already asking when the puppy can come), my husband is a competitive shooter so he is at the range a lot.  Sundays start with early church (have already been told that pup is welcome to come) & then reading or needlepoint on our front porch.  (God we sound boring).    Do have some issues with this specific April - which is when I understand the next batch of puppies will be up.  Holy Week Apr 13-Apr 20, is really really busy time for me at church.  And then we are going to the beach for a week starting the 9th of May and wouldn't be alble to take puppy since we are already committed to a non-dog condo.  End of May would be perfect.  If thats not possible, I'd be perfectly happy to puppy sit until the next batch comes along.    And on a really shallow note, , if I could pick the puppy it would be a black one since my Charlotte was black & all my carpets etc were chosen to hide black dog hair.  But yellow is fine as would be a German Shephard.  (Grew up with them.)"

During ten months of the year, I am a school teacher and keep a school schedule.  However, I do have some flexibilty and anticipate being able to come home for lunch so that the dog is never alone for too long.  Outside of school hours, including weekends and all summer, myself and my 3 kids will be available for puppy playing, socializing, and training.  We have an enclosed back yard for lots of puppy exercise.  We also have a semi-urban neighborhood and regularly walk around our town, whether to enjoy the weather, play at a park, or go get some ice cream.  We would offer the dog many different experiences in the course of our normal schedule: soccer games at the park, visiting friends with dogs, picking out books, or watching the street from our front porch.    Because of my work, I would love to get a puppy in the summer, so we could spend the mot time with it when it is young.  We have no preference, however, for type or gender.  Thanks!"

The dogs get several play, socialization, and elimination breaks during the day. Myself and the dogs go the the local recreation area at lunch time to walk the trails and socialize with other dogs and their owners.  Arrive home and play with my dog briefly before her evening meal and going off to the gym.  My dog is usually fast asleep by the time I get home from the gym.  Dogs are already integrated into my lifestyle, so meeting a pup's needs will be part of that integration.  My workplace is near a university campus and a shopping center so there are ample opportunities to expose the pup to real life situations."

They permit the puppy to go to work with me.  I have a crate in my office should I have to crate the puppy for any reason.  The people at work play an active role in helping me raise the puppy for example they would take the puppy out to get busy, they also help with expose to different types of people and greetings).  My husbands work also supports the program in allowing him to take th epuppy with him on occassions.  My oldest daughter during the school year is the first out at 6:30 am and home at 2:30 pm so when needed she helps in the morning and afternoon.  My youngest daughter goes to middle school at 8:30 am and home at 4:15 pm.  We have raised to dogs - one is a guide dog and the other is compleing her training to become a guide.  Everyone in the family alters schedules to make this work because we are committed."

We have 2 children ages 10 and 7, and my husband and I work full-time outside the home 4 days a week.  Our typical weekday schedule has us waking up at 6:00 (my husband will take the pup out to get busy while I shower), me dropping off kids at school at 8:00 (we can walk there with the pup), and me leaving for work at 9:00.  I can return  home from 12:30-1:30 to take the pup out to get busy and get some exercise, and then my husband comes home from work at 4:30, at which time he'll take the pup out to get busy and then walk the pup to pick the kids up at school.  I get home from work at 6:00 and we can be focused on the pup from 6:00-10:00 for training, exercise, fun time and relax time before bed.  On days we work from home, the schedule will be the same in the mornings up to 9:00, and rather than crate the pup from 9:00-12:30 and 1:30-4:30, we will have him with us while we work.  On weekends, our schedules are very open and flexible, and we can dedicate all our time to the pup, planning experiences for training and fun, and working him into our own activities and errands.  I've developed a spreadsheet with some example daily schedules to show how the pup can be incorporated into our lives."

Jerry (father/husband) works in Manhattan and travels for work throughout the year.  Kathleen (mother/wife) is a stay at home mom and therefore will be the main puppy raiser.  Megan (10) and Kylie (7) are active children that are excited to work with a pup.  We had a Lab for 13 years that was an integral part of our family.  Both of the girl's first words where his name, Jack.  We live on a private lane in Westport.  There are many children and dogs in the neighborhood -- but no sidewalks.  The family spends most of our time on the first floor of our private house.  The bedrooms are all upstairs.  A typical weekday is hectic in the morning with Jerry leaving before anyone else is awake.  Kathleen gets up with the children and gets them to school.  About once a week this entails a 7:30 carpool with 4 other children.  Ideally we will then walk to the bus by 8:10 (we drive if later).  Kathleen spends 3 mornings a week visiting Jerry's mother.  She has moderate Altzeihmer's and lives in Brookdale, and assisted living facility about 10 minutes away.  Kathleen plans to take the pup to Brookdale whenever possilbe.  Mrs. Doyle is a lifelong Lab lover and looks forward to interacting with the pup.    The later part of the morning/early afternoon would be dedicated to the pup and household chores & errands.  The girls are picked up from school at 3:15 and usually have activities right afterschool.  Mondays we have 3 additional girls come over before carpooling -- so it can be a bustling household.  Every Thursday afterschool, Kathleen leads a girl scout troop (she is a leader for both a 2nd & 5th grade troop at school).   After activities Kathleen cooks dinner while the girls complete their homework.  After dinner the girls often dance/jump around the house before bath & bedtime.  They are asleep by 8:30.  Kathleen & Jerry are up until about 11pm.  Weekends in our family vary.  We go to our home in Ludlow, VT (about 3 1/2 hours away) at least once a month (we sometimes stay for up to a week during the summer).  We have a small, 2-story private house on a residential street in town.  There are sidewalks, and weather permitting, we walk into town every morning.  We often ski, but usually only for a half day.  We will be flexible based on the pup's needs.  We look forward to taking the pup on hikes in the summer (on a leash of course!).    Our weekends in CT are filled with social and sport activities (spring soccer, summer swimming).  We often entertain -- both adults & children.  Every other month or so we visit family in Eastern Long Island.  We've already discussed bringing the pup with us.    We are all very excited to raise a pup and look forward to spending lots of time trainging the pup and exposing him/her to lot's of varied activities and environments!"

She continues to make progress in the right direction.  Her one area of inconsistency as far as confidence is with grates that have space underneath them.  Leslie has given me some great training advice and we are starting to finally make some progress!!!  This will be one area I will specifically continue to work on as I feel that Rochelle can tackle her uncertainties with grates as well.,1409,Primary,22799,0,26,6R410,Rochelle,2011-01-13 00:36:22,"A typical week for me looks like this:  Monday through Friday – Wake at 4:45 A.M. to feed, change water, clean litter box and play with our five indoor cats and then to feed and water the chickens.  This takes until 5:00 or 5:30.  In this time span I used to feed and water and let Jake out to “get busy” before and after eating (Jake was my husband’s retired GEB dog who recently passed away.)  5:30 – 6:00 – spare time to watch the news, play with the cats, pack lunch, etc.    6:00 – 6:45 – get ready for work and head out.  This takes a little longer in the winter due to needing to warm up the truck and remove snow if necessary.  If you need to know for travel purposes with the puppy, I drive a two seater pick-up truck so the puppy will be trained to sit on the floor of the passenger side like Paul’s two GEB dogs were trained to do.  6:45 – 7:45 – Drive to Columbus to the Ohio State School for the Blind where I work as an O&M specialist.  I have already gotten approval from the school administration to bring the puppy to work with me on a daily basis.  8:00 – 8:53 – Prep period in office (My office is a quiet place with little traffic, I have an office mate who is fine with me bringing the puppy into the office) – this time is usually spent lesson planning, report writing, talking with other teachers about students or getting ready for the day.  It is a “Free time” to get done what needs to be done for the day.    9:00 – 11:45 – The morning of my day is broken up into 4 lesson times for O&M.  The lesson times vary from 42 minutes long (1 class period) to 84 minutes long (2 class periods back to back). When I am out of my office for lessons, my office mate is out on her own lessons as well and the office will be empty.  The puppy will not be going on lessons with me due to the distraction factor for my students and because this will be a good time for the puppy to sleep.  11:45 – 12:20 – During this time I am doing lunch duty in while the students eat.  12:20 – 1:07 – My lunch time.  I am usually done eating in 10 minutes, so the rest of this time is free.  1:07 – 2:30 – This time is 2 - 42 minute long  lessons or 1 – 84 minute long lesson with a student at which time the puppy will remain in my office.  3:15 – 4:00 – Wrap up the day.  4:00 – 5:00 – Drive time (or when I have my puppy, I will use this opportunity to go for an afternoon walk before heading home because I will have access to sidewalks, etc.)  Due to having so many animals, at least once a week there is a trip to the pet store for supplies before jumping on the freeway for home.  About one other time during the week there is usually another errand that needs to be run.  And Thursdays I will be driving straight from work to puppy class in Berea.  When I arrive home, the first thing I do is take care of the cats, chickens and make dinner.  The rest of the evening is spent doing household chores or filling empty time.  10:00 – 11:00 – Bedtime  Saturdays and Sundays –I use this time usually to grocery shop if need be or run other errands.  It is pretty flexible.  An important note:  Paul (my husband) is away at school at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, MI.  He is getting his Master’s in Vision Rehabilitation Therapy.  I travel up there to see him 2 times a month.  It is a 5 hour drive one way.  The typical trip is a Saturday morning into a Sunday afternoon.  Paul lives in an apartment on campus and his resident advisor is fine with him having me as a visitor with a GEB puppy.  This will only be until mid-May.  At this time in May, Paul will be moving back home to Fredericktown to start his internship in Columbus.   Our lifestyle is pretty quiet and laid back.  Neither Paul nor I are excitable people, but we like to make the most out of life and have fun.  We have a fenced in yard and a house that comfortably fits 5 cats, my husband and I and a puppy/dog.  We like routine and predictability but are very flexible with the interruptions that can happen at any given day.  We are very grounded people.  I understand, firsthand, what this puppy will one day mean to a person who is blind.  Whereas I have had dogs all of my life (golden retrievers as a kid and my husbands’ two GEB labs) it has been a LONG time since I have had a puppy.  This puppy will be intergrated into every part of my life, from a full work day to evening free time to traveling to Kalamazoo every other weekend for the next 4 months to visit Paul.  I have a huge support group behind me, my husband, my family and my workplace.  The only thing my work place administration is worried about is barking (so a less vocal pup is a request of mine).  If it were a perfect world then I would be matched with a black lab boy puppy who is laid back and has a soft soul, but that is in the spirit of our dear Jake who we miss so much.  Any dog you match me with I will raise with the utmost love and respect and guidance so that this exceptional animal’s future career goal is met with success."

While Petey was great and not noisy, I know it had its stress for him. We had lots of city exposures and training ops. One concern is sometimes an inability to settle without direction. He can and does do it often. Out in the park, me reading a book... 20-30minutes, he might not ever just lie down and relax unless directed and might even whine then (now that I think about it).

I will be raising my third pup with GEB.  My typical day is free to do what I want and when the pup arrives I will be planning most of my days around pup;she will be socialized well.  Jack and I travel frequently and plan on taking the pup on trips with us.  I enjoy a quiet pup because I can connect easily with her (ideally I would like a pup like Maple - so sweet and gentle with people and appropriately assertive with other dogs).  We live in a large house with 3 acres of land on a quiet road which forms a 1 mile circle.  We are planning on putting up a temporary fence enabling the pup to run around.  Our house is very quiet, except when the grandchildren are visiting.  Our grandchildren are are Payton, 5 years old, and Adalyn, 2 years old.  We visit them often in NH.  We will be getting a new grandchild in the middle of June.  Sometime in June or July, I will need to go to Houston to help out and may stay  up to 4 weeks (probably a lot less) accordingly to how badly I am needed.  The plans for this travel and the time I will be needed have not been finalized yet.  I love GEB, I love the instructors and the other raisers and most of all - I love the pup.  I have been known to take time off between pups and have been pup-sitting a lot since Maple went for her IFT - Nanette, Lani, Juliann, Harriet, and have had pup sleepovers frequently: Farley, Lolly.  What I've learned from these experiences is that all pups are different and all, every one of them, are so very special with lots of love to give."

Per GEB vet, she was seen by our sponsor vet who prescribed an anti-inflammatory and told to rest.  After completing the medicine, limping began again.  She was subsequently seen by the GEB vet mid October and was diagnosed with suspected soft tissue damage and mandated crate rest for 2-3 weeks and given Rimadyl.  After the Rimadyl was finished, she began to limp again. I drove her back to the GEB vet November 5 and they had her seen by their Orthopedist.  She was diagnosed e with having lumbar/groin injury and  received a laser treatment  and Rimadyl and again placed on strict rest.  After the medication was finished, she began to favor the leg again, although not limping outright. I was given permission to have her seen by a local orthopedist for evaluation and laser treatment.  Orthopedic Vet confirmed previous diagnosis and was prescribed Rimadyl and Robaxin.  This vet recommended 4-6 weeks of weekly physical therapy/laser treatment and home exercises.  First treatment was Monday 1/2.  As a result of all of this, Dolly's training and socialization has been severely compromised.  Stairs continue to be an issue.  She still goes up and down closed stairs like a young pup, with two hind legs scampering together.  She is fearful of open back stairs.",,,,,26,,,,

He also occasionally needs over-the-counter eyedrops for red or itchy eyes.",5,Payson has not had problems in this area.  ,5,"walking on a leash around the town, occasional play in a fenced-in dog park (with his friend Scarlett or alone)",30-60,5,Payson has not had any accidents in his crate since the first week we had him.  ,5,"Payson has not made any noise in his crate in a long time.  If he is put in the crate when he doesnÆt want to be there (something more interesting is going on outside the crate), he will repeatedly sit up and stare at us instead of settling down, but he does not make noise.  ",5,"Payson always goes into the crate when asked.  Sometime he is slow to walk into the crate and has to be prompted (usually we point into the crate if he is slow), but he does not refuse to go in.  We still put treats in the crate before prompting him, since we never heard we should stop doing so, but we will plan to try phasing that out in the next few weeks as it now occurs to me that he probably should be able to go in the crate without treats.  ",5,"Payson will very occasionally take his towel from his crate and settle down to try to chew on it.  We notice this pretty quickly and put it back into the crate, and he will usually leave it there.  He does not seem to chew the towel inside the crate.  Otherwise, he only chews his toys.  ",5,"PaysonÆs house manners have significantly improved lately.  The bath mat has been out for about a month, with only once incident occurring in the first few days of it being reintroduced.  He initially enjoyed playing with the toilet paper, so we had kept it off the roll for a few months.  He is now able to totally ignore toilet paper and we can keep it on the roll, finally!  He has not been taking things from tables and on the occasions that he sniffs things that are not his, he responds well when we say ôuh-uh,ö which is his negative marker to let him know he is about to make the wrong choice.  ",5,"I have started leaving Payson uncrated while I am in the shower during the last few weeks.  I usually choose to shower when he is tired and napping anyway, and this seems to work well.  He will either remain napping where he is, or he will nap on the bath mat outside the shower.  Once when he was more active, he did get his towel out of the crate and lay on it (an indication that he may have been chewing it, which we do not like for him to do), but that is the worst mischief he has done while unattended.  ",5,Payson is 100% housebroken.,4,"Payson still occasionally plays a little bit rough with his toys and sometimes puts his teeth on one of us when grabbing for a toy (it does seem to be a genuine accident when this happens).  Usually this happens if we are playing tug, as he will sometimes put his mouth too close to our hands on the rope toy.  This is becoming more rare, and he seems to be learning to play more gently.  ",5,"Payson doesnÆt really have the opportunity to steal food.  He has not jumped on the counters or tables to get food or anything like that, but we do not leave it unattended where he could get to it.  He does sometimes come up to the table and sniff up near a plate if it has especially delicious-smelling food on it, and he tries to lick the edge of the plate.  We have been letting him know this is not appropriate behavior but he still shows interest in food on the table sometimes.  ",5,"Payson sometimes still rests a toy on the coffee table or ottoman, but this is becoming less frequent as well.  He does not get on the furniture otherwise.  ",4,"Payson sometimes barks at another dog when he is on leash and I am talking to the dogÆs owner.  He does this when he is frustrated because he wants to play with the dog, but he is not allowed to get very close to the dog (the same type of barking he does in puppy class from time to time).  ThatÆs really the only time he barks.  ",4,"We have been slowly increasing PaysonÆs access to the garbage and he is doing well.  Payson is consistently able to ignore the trash can in the bathroom, but we are still careful not to throw away paper towels or tissues in that trash can because he finds those too interesting.  ",5,"Payson doesnÆt jump on the counters.  He does sometimes sniff food on top of the table or very occasionally on a countertop, as described above, but he keeps all four paws on the ground.   He does not paw or scratch at doors, but if you go into a room without him and close the door, he will lay down and lean against the door to wait for you to come back.    ",5,"Payson has very occasionally jumped up toward a person who was greeting him, but only if the person was acting exciting, or if it was a person he knew.  We discourage this behavior, and it is not frequent (especially in the past few weeks), but it has happened before.  ",5,"Payson is always friendly to other animals.  He is still an excitable playmate when he plays with Scarlett (and apparently Simon), but he is never aggressive or unfriendly.  ",5,"Payson loves children.  He is still excited when he is around them and has to be distracted with treats or he will turn and lick the children.  I donÆt really like for him to do this because it seems to startle kids or parents, but he has never tried to jump on a child or do anything aside from lick them.  He is getting better, and will sit or stand still more frequently while greeting children.  ",5,Payson is friendly with everyone.  ,4,"Payson is usually excellent with his loose-leash walking, but we are giving him a 4 because he sometimes gets too involved in sniffing.  I have noticed that in the summer heat, he is much more easily distracted and his loose-leash walking and check-in skills suffer noticeably in the heat.  He can only go on a 10- or 15-minute walk without getting distracted if the temperature is over about 85 degrees.  As a result I have tried to walk him in cooler weather, which is better for both of us anyway, but I am mentioning it in case it is a problem that he is easily distracted in the heat.  He has also been sniffing more lately, and it can be difficult to regain his attention.  For the most part though, he walks very well on his leash.  ",5,"Payson will usually go when asked.  We have been working on getting him comfortable with getting busy on the asphalt parking lot behind our building.  He definitely does not want to go on the pavement, and it takes several unsuccessful trips outside before he resigns himself to the inevitable and goes on the pavement.  He will only urinate on the pavement.  WeÆre still trying to work on this, but we have to do it when we have time to take him out multiple times in a row over a few hours, because he is really stubborn!  He is also having the weird problem we mentioned in class, where he is afraid to finish pooping in one spot and will pull on the leash after he is finished and try to run away.  ",4,"Now that Payson is having the issue described above, he sometimes does not finish all his business in one trip and will occasionally have to go unexpectedly while on a walk.  He had been doing well with not eliminating on walks prior to this weird problem, and hopefully this will go away when we fix his other issue.  ",4,"Payson is usually able to ignore pigeons.  He is more easily distracted by squirrels, but unless they are very close or are running away, he doesnÆt try to chase them.  Usually he will just stare at them for a long time, but heÆs getting better with this, too.  ",5,Payson doesnÆt seem bothered by traffic.,5,"Sometimes Payson is startled by a noise (for example, I dropped a big metal bowl near his head while he was sleeping the other nightùoops!), but he doesnÆt seem to react with fear, he reconnects quickly afterward, and he doesnÆt seem to have lasting anxiety about it.  ",3,"Payson is sometimes great on the stairs, and sometimes seems afraid.  He had an issue with the stairs at BenÆs house, where the stairs are less than 3 feet wide.  Ben said that Payson would have to be lured up the stairs, and would turn around right before reaching the top and go all the way back down.  We have narrow stairs (35 inches wide) in our building, with one side closed and one side with a railing.  We practice with these, and Payson is frequently able to go up or down all six flights (two flights per story of the building) with no trouble.  Then, the next time we try, he sometimes needs much more encouragement than he did the previous time.  The next time, he might seem fine on the stairs.  I canÆt tell what makes the difference in his attitudeùsame stairs, same people.  He does not like to stop on the stairs ever, though.  Sometimes I sit on the stairs and talk to him and he will sit at the bottom of the stairs and look at me, and will maybe put a paw on the second step, but he wonÆt come up.  We try to practice this with him frequently, but I think we need some help figuring out how to make Payson feel more comfortable, especially since he is unpredictably and intermittently anxious on the stairs.  ",5,"Payson always sits when asked.  Sometimes, though, he will move closer to me and then sit, rather than sitting where he is.  He seems to want to sit in the heel position a lot of the time.  Usually this happens in the elevator, where it is good for him to be close to me as it is sometimes crowded, but I donÆt want him to think he can sit wherever he wants to instead of where we asked him to sit.  It would be good to get some tips for working with him on this.  ",5,"Payson is pretty good about laying down on command.  He is sometimes slow to lay down if he is distracted, but he doesnÆt really refuse to do it.  ",5,"Payson has a good stay.  If we have been practicing many things or if he is getting excited, he will sometimes get up from the stay to move a few feet closer.  For the most part, though, he is doing great.  If I tell him to sit and stay in the kitchen and go into another room where he canÆt see me, he will still hold the stay.  Then I recall him into the other room and he does great with that, too!",5,"Payson is good about coming to us when called.  He will even go past a food bowl that is a foot away from his path to us, although he does look at the food bowl longingly as he goes by.  We have not tried putting food in the bowl yet, as IÆm not sure he would be able to resist that.",5,"Payson almost always comes when called off lead.  I once called him when he was playing with Scarlett and got a little too excited, and it took a few tries for him to come to me.  He did eventually come, though, which was great!  Also, sometimes if he has been asleep and we are calling him to come to us, he will walk slowly and stretch his back legs as he walks.  IÆm not sure if the ideal situation is for him to sprint to us every time as he has been doing in class.  Even though he walks slowly sometimes, he does not take detours and he does get to us in the end.   ",5,"Payson has only had to take his heartworm so far, and he always enjoys that.  ",4,"Payson does not enjoy having his ears cleaned.  He was much more reluctant to have his ears cleaned when he had the ear infection, understandably so because it probably hurt to have them touched.  He did try to get away that time, but he has become better about it once his ear stopped hurting.   If he sees the bottle of ear cleaner, he will walk away hoping that he will not be noticed.  Once you catch him, though (we donÆt turn it into a game of chase), he does not try to get away.  He will let one person clean his ears while the other gives him treats. ",5,"Payson doesnÆt mind having his nails trimmed.  Usually Payson leans on me and gets treats while Michael clips the nails, and Payson never seems to have a problem with it.  He also got his nails trimmed once at the vet, and he didnÆt like it as much, but the vet said that he was very good.  ",5,,<map object at 0x7f0e89bfe400>,5,5,1,"We have also noticed Payson sniffing more lately.  Sometimes, he is difficult to reconnect with during a sniffing session, if he is focused on an interesting smell.  We try to avoid this happening in the first place, but sometime he gets very focused on a smell very quickly.  For example, in the elevator, he sniffs the carpet very intensely.  I try to use the leash to restrict his options so that he canÆt reach the floor as easily, because he usually is concentrating too hard to respond to his name.  Usually he will pick his head up with a great effort and look at me, and his teeth will be chattering and his lips flapping aroundùit seems like his body is trying to continue sniffing while his brain is trying to respond to his name being called.  This teeth-chattering thing seems kind of weird to us, and we wanted to see if this was a normal behavior and to ask how we can help Payson keep from sniffing.    We would also like some help working with Payson on getting over his sporadic anxiety about stairs, and his skills in performing commands at a distance.    Otherwise, we have noticed a significant improvement in PaysonÆs house manners and his ability to control his excitement level (especially in public).  We are hoping Payson will be eligible for his puppy jacket at this walk and talk.  We are very proud of his progress!   ",1072,Primary,24152,0,26,3P411,Payson,2012-02-07 15:57:40,"I am working on a master's degree in library science online.  I am taking classes full-time and I am not working so that I can get through the master's program more quickly.  I am not planning to get a job until I am finished with the degree.  I will graduate in December or next May, and will hopefully find a job in a library afterward.  In my experience library jobs tend to offer fairly flexible schedules, and when the time comes I don't foresee a problem with accommodating the pup's needs.  For now, though, my schedule is almost entirely flexible.    I wake up in the morning anywhere between 8:30 and 10:30, but I will adapt this to fit the puppy’s schedule.  I sleep later now because I don’t have to be a certain place by a certain time, but with a pup to look after, this would be different.  I wake up, have breakfast, read for a little while to give myself time to wake up, and then take a shower and get ready for the day.  My day is pretty simple because I spend most of my time reading textbooks, writing papers, and working on assignments during the day.  Usually I go to Starbucks or the library to study for a couple of hours in the morning or afternoon (one or the other). While the pup is on a schedule where he needs to go out every hour or so, I plan to stay at home during the day to attend to his bathroom needs.  I could study at Starbucks again occasionally when the pup is old enough to stay in a crate for a few hours, but I can study effectively at home so this isn’t a requirement.  If I don’t go to Starbucks to study, I like to go on a walk around downtown White Plains, go on an errand to the grocery store or Target, or go to the gym downstairs.  These activities each usually take about an hour.    Michael gets home around six in the evenings, and we usually have dinner between six and eight.  We watch a TV show or read in the evenings, and I spend time knitting or working on homework.  I have class from 6-10 pm on Mondays and Thursdays, and I have to concentrate most of my attention on class during this time.  Michael is home by the time class starts or shortly thereafter.  He can take responsibility for the puppy on those nights.  Once or twice a week we go out for a few hours in the evening to go to a movie or hang out with friends—this is of course flexible.  On weekends we bake, run errands, go for walks, and do chores around the house.  For example, we might go to a yarn store or the grocery store.  Sometimes we visit NYC for the day.  We don’t need to do this until the puppy is old enough to handle it, and we could spend shorter periods of time there so as not to overwhelm him.  We usually take the train but driving the car is an option, too.  We are both very willing to plan our activities around the puppy’s needs and as you can see, my schedule in particular is very flexible.    I left my car in Atlanta, and I’m planning to leave it there at least until the ice and snow driving season is over.  I can walk everywhere I need to go during the day: the grocery store, Target, bookstore, Starbucks, library, etc. are all within easy walking distance.  Michael has a car and will be able to take the puppy and me where we need to go.  It’s also an option for me to drive him to work and use the car during the day—as long as it’s not snowing.  The puppy will be able to get used to riding in a car.    We live on the sixth floor of an apartment building in White Plains.  I don’t really know our neighbors, but they’re quiet.  Other dogs live in our building, so hopefully we will pick up some tips in class about how to handle running into these dogs on our way outside.  We have a one-bedroom apartment.  I will have time to take the dog on walks during the day so he won’t be too hyper or feel cooped up inside.    The main thing that I wanted to talk to you about is that one of the conditions of my move to New York was that I would be able to visit my family in Atlanta occasionally.  I am very close to my mom, so it is important to me to be able to see her.  Michael and I had planned for me to fly to Atlanta approximately once every two months or so.  Since I can continue my class work there, I had planned to spend about a week there at a time.  It is important to me that I am able to visit with my family sometimes, but I will make it a priority to plan these trips in the best interest of the puppy.  Michael and I have thought about options to take care of the puppy’s needs in this situation.  With all the dogs in our apartment building, we could find a responsible dog walker to let the dog out at lunchtime if this is acceptable to Guiding Eyes.  If not, Michael could come home during his lunch break if necessary.  Also, I don’t know what the Guiding Eyes policy is on bringing puppies on airplanes once they are old enough to handle it, but if Guiding Eyes and the airline would allow it, I’d be willing to bring the dog with me so he would have experience with flying.  My priority is to plan visiting around the puppy’s needs.    Finally, I’d like to request that we get a Lab rather than a German Shepherd if possible.  I have allergies, and allergy medicine helps enough that I am fine around Labs (my family’s dog, Ivy, is a Lab) but I don’t think I would do as well with a German Shepherd.    I tried to include everything I could think of about what my life is like--hopefully I didn't write too much!  Please call or email if you have any questions or want to discuss anything!  Thanks :)"

Jeremy and Zach attend universities and are not home most of the year.  We all love puppies /dogs. We have a 2 year old female golden doodle named Sunny who is a little shy but very loving and friendly. She is our second dog. Our first died after only 31/2 years from kidney disease. She was a yellow lab..  My schedule is probably more flexible than most because i am blessed to be a stay at home Mom. Now that our third son is in high school I have a little more free time and would like to ""give something back"" by raising a guiding eyes puppy.  Daily I tend to anything and everything my family needs which consists mostly of cleaning, cooking, running errands, keeping in touch with family, and taking my son to various practices and games and picking him up from school.  On the weekend  we are typically having or attending some kind of family/friend gathering and or attending our sons baseball games. Occasionally we will road trip to see our sons at their various schools but since the end of the school year is here the soonest that would happen would be typically the end of September or in October.  We usually take a family summer driving vacation so puppy would be able to join us.  The only inflexible time when we will not be able to have the puppy with us is when we fly out of town the day after Christmas for a yearly family vacation. We live on a cul-de-sac on a very quiet street and have a very large fenced in back yard that is great for puppies/dogs. My 2 sisters have dogs one a 3 year old lab and the other a 1 year old golden retriever that will also be  optional socialization experiences."

Everyone is out of the house between 6:30 & 8:30.  The kids begin returning home around 2:30 & usually everyone is home by 6:30.  In the winter, we go back out for hockey practice & get back after 11:00.  On the weekends we tend to stay home & relax.  We don't leave town many times during the year.  When we go to visit family we take our dog with us.  We would have to determine if this works with the GEB pup.  We have 3 kids, the oldest graduated from UCONN this past spring & has recently found a job and for now is living at home.  The other two are a junior & senior in high school.  They are both involved in sports, and we are avid supporters of their sports.  We go to hockey games, soccer games & lacrosse games often.  Often the non participating kid stays home, so there is often someone home.  We have an 8 month old puppy.  He is a bernese, newfoundland mix.  His name is Harley, so it would probably be important not to have a GEB pup with a similar name.  We would prefer to have a male.  Harley is scheduled to be neutered in the next week."

My kids are self-sufficient and get dressed by themselves, get their breakfast and lunch and head out the door between 7-7.30 for school. My daily routine is then very flexible, in the morning I do exercise at the gym or at home, if at the gym I am generally back home about 10 am. In the mornings I also clean the house put on Laundry and check emails. My other daily tasks are running errands such as shopping. My other activities that I do on a regular basis is attend a sewing group once a week, I try to hit golf balls or play golf, I attend my Group MAWA where we have a pot-luck luncheon once a month, or I catch up with friends for a walk and coffee. Other than that my time is quite flexible.  The kids start coming home at 2.45-3.30 pm they have various after school activites that I need to get them too and these vary each day and change throughout the year depending on the sport season. 6.30 pm we are normally home for dinner, the kids then get ready for bed at 8.00 pm. I then watch TV, sew or read until 10.30 pm when I retire to bed. My husbands job requires that we occasionally are required to attend evening functions, but the kids are at an age where they stay at home on their own. These functions occur about 3-4 times a month. Our 14 year old son is taking a very active role in this process and I feel confident that he will be able to step up to help with the Pup. As we are living temporarily in the US, we do intend to travel, our next trip away is booked for January 28th for a week, but we do from time to time head away on weekends, and it would be our intention if permission is given to take the dog away with us overnight, usually we travel 3-4 hrs away. We live in a large three level house, with a yard, it is a rental property and we will be concerned about teaching to dog very good house manners."

After school, there is usually a teenager doing homework or going for a run or to a sports practice. Although we are very active, our home is situated in a very quiet dead end neighbor hood with four other houses.  There are a few other dogs around, including our three year old lab, but only one other child who often stops in to say hello.  We are adjacent to Water Company Land as well as State Forest.  We have very little traffic.  On weekends we are often atttending our children's soccer games or other sporting events.         Our oldest son, Sam, has autism and loves dogs.  He is not overly affectionate with his dogs but rather simply enjoys their company.  Our dogs have been essential companions for Sam, it seems to work for them.  Thus, we are extremely  interested in the Heeling Autism program!

I've been volunteering a fair amount at CDC in the BK and driving for Kathi Carey which I'd like to continue doing as much as possible. My regular BK session is 3-7PM on Thursdays but I often fill in at other times and I drive as required. I'm often at the CDC 3-4 times a week helping out in some capacity. I very much enjoy that, but understand that my volunteering may be impacted by the time I need to devote to puppy raising. Maybe there's a balance that will work for all concerned. When I'm not at the CDC, I'm usually up around 7AM, breakfast and emails until around 9AM. I then usually exercise (biking or ice hockey depending on the season) until mid-day, with chores, house maintenance, shopping, reading taking up a good part of the afternoon. When I travel which is not that often, I usually know well in advance. I live on the top of a hill in Sherman, CT on a very quiet road which is great for walks and there are plenty of trails and parks for exercise. My yard is not fenced in. I live approx 30 minutes from CDC. I don't have any physical limitations."

Plenty of socialization in house and in neighborhood...regular flow of guests in house and passerbys in neighborhood, some classical musicians will occassionally be playing live music in music room (off living room) - as well, regular classical / light jazz music (piano and voice) practice by puppy raiser. Plenty of neighborhood animals (dogs and cats) nearby (three cats live across the street - a golden retriever next to that house - AND - a skunk lives in a cave on waterway side of my driveway!) Young children - toddlers in  house Golden retriever house across street. I spend a lot of time outside and inside doing light home improvement projects, gardening, etc...relatively big yard, lot is close to 1/2 acre. Well lit but quiet location considering on an intersection. I will be going for both short and extended walks with dog, also day exploration trips and to the beach. I also imagine bringing him with me occassionally to agency appointments (commercial insurance offices) when appropriate age and readiness. I would like to bring pup to schools for learning presentations, too. I will have a few neighborhood kids who will want to participate with training (junior high and highschool age.) I tend lately to have stay-cations, more that out-of-town. if I go out of town, it is normally for no more than one week at a time."

His humping issues seem to have resolved, he does not try to hump the kids when playing like he used to do and has done well with other dogs in the last few months as well.  I feel that at this point dog distractions are his biggest issue, especially on walks but we are working on distancing ourselves so that he can maintain control and that works well.  He will also steal the kids stuffed animals from time to time and they have gotten good at putting them where they are not accessible but if given the opportunity he will take them, although he is quick to ""out"" when caught.

Jeremy does not have a set time that he needs to be at work so sometimes he is gone before then and sometimes he is not.  Mason has preschool three days a week and I am home every morning.  Twice a week I go into work at 12:30 pm at which time Jeremy comes home to watch Mason and get the kids off the bus at 4 pm.  On the nights I do not work Jeremy is usually home by 6 pm and we go about the kids sports/activities when they have them during the week.  I work all day every other Saturday and Jeremy is home on those days.  Sundays we attend church for 3 hours and are usually home the rest of the day.  Unless we are running errands, there is almost always either Jeremy or I at home.  My schedule is fairly flexible as to which days I have to work during the week with enough notice and Jeremy can work from home when needed.  Our kids are getting older (youngest turns 5 in April) and we now have the time and energy to devote to a puppy, as well as having them take part in helping.  We are looking forward to the bonding that we will all have doing this together."

A typical weekday is us waking at 5:30, taking our dog out and feeding her, Brian's off to school by 6:45, and I usually will walk my dog for an hour from 8-9.

I finished course work for my MSW (social work degree). I did 1 fieldplacement and have one left. In fall of 2013 I will start my second fieldplacement.This placement will be 20 hours per week. My husband, David, works from 7:30 to 4 (normally). He has a flexible work schedule.     We have children (ages 5 and 6). We have 3 dogs (2 are ages 10+ and 1 is 4).     Typical Monday - Friday schedule:  9am - walk my son, Sawyer, to the bus stop  9am - drive daughter, Bronte, to preschool  9:30 - 2 - Bronte at school. Time for me to do errands, etc.   2 - pick Bronte up from school  2 - 4 - hang out at home, play with friends, take classes, etc  4:30 - walk to Sawyer's bus stop (Mondays he gets home at 1:30)  5 to bedtime - football practice one night a week, play with neighborhood friends, eat, take baths, etc.     Typical Weedend  Football/soccer games, hang out with friends, school events, etc. We will have no issue getting the puppy to class every Sunday.     I will have a significant amount of free time to dedicate to the puppy. We live in a house with a fenced back yard. We also live on a cul de sac. My kids and their friends play a lot outside after school and on the weekends.    We're from California and visit 2x a year. We generally don't go anywhere else.     My kids have grown up with dogs and went through the puppy stage with one of our dogs. The kids love to play with our younger dog. The younger dog also loves the kids. The older dogs love to cuddle with the kids when they're watching TV or reading books.     We've fostered some homeless puppies recently, and everyone (including the dogs) did fine. The last dog was 6 months old. It took a week or so for one of the older dogs to adjust, but he was accepting after a period of time. Our younger dog loved the last puppy and seemed depressed after he found a home.      One of my dogs barks, but the others don't.    The bottom line is that our schedule, epecially mine, is pretty flexible and there will be plenty of time to socialize the puppy."

I generally walk a mile every morning after rising and then return to the house for breakfast, and reading (newspapers/books).  Some days I volunteer at a local food pantry perhaps once a month, but otherwise my daytime schedule centers on reading, home improvement projects, house maintenance projects, and errands.  In the summer I may go for a mid-day swim and also an evening swim at our local pool club.  In the winter I might do the mid-day swim if I re-join the gym at a local college.  If I take another class in January my activity will likely focus on class readings, etc. Evenings are devoted to meal preparation/cleanup, F2F conversation with Paula over dinner and for me, typically watching a sporting event or movie on tv if I do not have a scheduled meeting or class.  The evening classes are usually no more than one evening per week.  These classes vary and depend upon my free time and interest level.  I also occasionally have evening meetings for organizations that I support e.g. a church committee meeting, and I also serve on the board of a local organization – Hilltop Hanover Farm.  These groups meet no more frequently than once monthly for a 2-3 hour period. I attend choir practice weekly 1+ hours in the evening.  These absences from the home can generally be covered by my wife Paula who works from home and could be with the pup for feeding, and other exercise and outside activities.    On weekends we both attend to Saturday errands some of which could develop into training exercises. We typically socialize with friends on Saturday evening, e.g. dining out, hosting a dinner party, or seeing a movie. On Sunday we are typically both at church.  I go early for choir rehearsal and then depending on what is happening typically stay a bit afterwards for our coffee hour.  This entire period of time would be between 2-3 hours.  I could see this experience also being a training exercise for the pup as he/she gets older so that the pup can be acquainted with different sounds and people contact.  We have no other pets at home and our children are grown.  In fact, one is engaged and will marry in March 2013.  This is a one week trip in mid-to-late March 2013 that will require international travel. We live in a private residence.    On the health front I am in good health at age 62, however I will be consulting an orthopedist soon for slight knee pain.  Depending upon the results I may require minor knee surgery, but that is not known at this point -- just a worse-case scenario.    In closing, I will be the primary puppy handler and believe that my schedule is flexible and can be adapted with minimal adjustment to the needs of a Guiding Eyes puppy and the requirements of being a puppy raiser. Paula would be backup when I need to be out of the house for errands and meetings."

He is extremely social, wants to meet everyone, wants to play with every dog he sees, and has generally charmed everyone with whom he interacts. His enthusiasm is well-tempered and the few times he forgets his restraint, he corrects quickly and willingly.  The two things that would be of concern as a working dog are his high dog distraction and his great unwillingness to let you fuss with his paws, especially to trim his nails (a first in the the now 9 GEB dogs we've raised). We are confident the genius trainers at GEB will overcome both barriers to his success as a guide (dare we even hope stud?).  We will greatly miss Chaz and he has already charmed one potential partner, Mario Bonds, who plans to retire GEB Guide Sidney (whom we raised and look forward to welcoming home later this year).  We remain proud, honored, and lucky to be working with GEB and the tremendous dogs produced and trained there. We look forward to upping our game with the 10th pup.  ",,,,,26,,,,

My daughter currently attends Northern VA Community College. I work in an office environment but telecommute from home two days a week (Tues, Thurs). My expectations would be to bring the puppy into work on Mon, Wed, Fri when old enough. The primary handler would be me. My daughter would be secondary (and be attending the weekly classes with me).

I'm home during the day to care for the puppy while the boys are at school and my husband is at work.  I do go out for an hour or two a few days of the week for errands/gym but I can be flexible with that.  Later the boys do their after school sports, then I provide dinner (not always prepared by me - sometimes the guy at the deli prepares dinner!) then homework, recreational  time and then bed.  Bedtime depends on how late kids are studying and can go until midnight.  Our activity on the weekends is generally high, although we do like and need to make most of our down time.  The house can get very quiet when we know we have nowhere to go and nothing to do.   We have a family of boys and they strongly agree we should have a male puppy (don't ask).  My teenage boys are active and excited about participating in the program, so I expect the puppy will get plenty of exercise and a lot of care from them.  We live in a single family home with a large deer-fenced yard.  Like all suburban volunteers, in order to introduce him to the rest of the world, the puppy will be in and out of the car.  Although I haven't planned this yet, I was hoping we could take a 5 - 7 day family trip at the end of August.  Other than that possibility,  there are no leaves/vacations planned."

On Saturdays I enjoy outdoor activities or attending art or music festivals.  On Sundays I go to a church service and Sunday School class in the morning and a small home group in the evenings.  My husband is in the Air Force, and he will be deployed this year, leaving in June, so I will have more time to dedicate to raising a puppy.  (I previously raised puppies for Canine Companions for Independence, so I am aware of how much time needs to be dedicated to a puppy--especially a young puppy!)

Lately she has begun to ""test"" me when I ask certain behaviors (Kennel, Load up, Go Place) if she doesn't feel like obeying.  I am working through this with her by maintaining the hand gesture associated with the command and waiting for her to offer the behavior.  When she does, she gets rewarded enthusiastically.  If she continues to refuse (avoids eye contact, lays down with her back to me) and becomes distracted I try to re-engage her with other commands and then ask for the behavior again once she is re-connected.",,,,,26,,,,

I backtrack and try to get him to focus more on me than on his surroundings. We have spent a lot of time this winter practicing up and down our street. He does improve with lots of stops and turns, but does better in the driveway and street than on the sidewalks. Also, he seems to crave attention and tries to approach anyone who is near. He can be very stubborn and pull or jump up to see people. It is often hard to get him to focus on me and sit and wait to be greeted. He also is very forceful with our dog. They may start by playing tug, but it can quickly escalate to out of control chasing and Ken often grabs Rylee by the back of the neck or collar.",,,,,26,,,,

We have seen her personality change and some behavior changes since the arrival of Felicia (retired GEB dog).  Her interest in other dogs has reduced (as we previously did not have a dog).  She is more confidendent, independent, and less reliant on human interaction, but does show an insistence on getting attention if Felicia is getting attention.  Her response has never been to growl, bite, or bark, but but rather to jump or push in.  (This seems to be reducing as time passes, and we are stern with such jumping/excited behavior.)   She has played hard with Felicia, and we have been strict with her about pulling ears and biting Felicia's legs during play.   Felicia's arrival has been positive for Gaila, but we have also had to adjust (and are continuing to adjust) as Gaila seems less less responsive to commands and less interested in ""listening"" to her humans. We continue to seek a ""balance"" with two dogs in our household, as well as learning to effectively respond to Gaila's new sense of independence and failure to listen.  (Her reduced willingness to follow commands and listen could also be due to her age - 9 months.)   The ""girls"" have settled in together, very well, and enjoy each other's company.  We have continued to maintain a strict regime - exercise, kennel, eating.  The additional exercise from playing with Felicia has increased food intake.  ",,,,,26,,,,

Primary training responsibilities fall to Jeffrey; however, April is available especially in the early months to assist during the day while Jeffrey is in school (6:30-2:30).  April works part time and can arrange her schedule to be gone at most 4 hours during the day, many days she is either available all day or only out for 2-3 hours.  We have a large (coon hound mix) dog, 4 years old, who is quite energetic. Our first concern is how she will react to the puppy.  She has never been aggressive but can be excitable and needs a lot of activity during the day.  The household also has a 7 year old boy who, while energetic, is fairly calm and used to being around dogs.  He occasionally has friends visit which could create temporary chaos.  Weekends are flexible and usually involve multiple people who can be around.  We usually travel for several days around Christmas to an environment where a puppy would not be welcome so we would need help then.  We also have a summer vacation of a week (but obviously no need to worry about that until next year now)."

My husband works at home the majority of the time, with office trips 0 - 4 days a week.   Mostly--he is home.  So, if I leave for a while, the pup has someone to say with.  Pup won't be left alone at all until she/he feels safe in a crate.  We have two dogs--one sluggly golden and one high-energy shepherd is loves to teach and play with puppies!  She is so good at teaching them--it is adorable to watch!  Course--she tries to teach them undesirable things as well, sometimes, so we watch her instructions constantly!  We walk our dogs 4 miles a day, so will incorporate that into the puppies routine when pup is able.  We have a large fenced in yard (6 ft vinyl), so there is lots of opportunity for play time and exercise.  Plus--I need to get out of the house!  So, the pup will be going everywhere!  I am hoping you will give us a vest as soon as possible so I can work the pup up to shopping with us and going to restaurants on a regular basis.  Besides--you need to get those pups out in public so people know who you are around here!!!!"

She loves to cuddle with our Golden Retriever; enjoys our ""cuddle"" sessions, and has settled nicely into our daily routine. ItÆs amazing how quiet she is in the kennel. The animals go to bed around 10:00 pm and I stay up to watch TV. Even though the TV is on and Monty is not in a kennel, Gwenyth settles in and does not complain.  Sometimes during our training sessions she requires time to process a command. If there are other animals nearby, she is easily distracted.  Gwenyth is very ""mouthy"" and wiggly in the morning just after getting out of the kennel. I usually have a toy for her to put into her mouth and that keeps her from putting my hands into her mouth. I've noticed that she often goes for a toy herself now, so that seems to be a step in the right direction. She enjoys going for walks. The rainy, icy, frigid weather has limited our time to work outside. When I drive her into town to practice walking at the strip malls, I find that there is so much salt spread on the sidewalks that I need to wash her feet when we return home.  Gwenyth enjoys riding in the car. We took her along to Pennsylvania over the weekend and she did very well in the motel.  I really enjoy having her! I worry that her sheer strength can bowl me over. IÆm counting on her love and trust in me to motivate her to focus on our training sessions so she learns how to think about what she's doing and make the right choices.  ",,,,,26,,,,

Our household consists of just my partner (Mike Eaton) and I.  Mike is available on nights and weekends to help with the puppy.  We have a 4 year old GEB release dog (Hopi) in our home, who works as a pet therapy dog in the local hospital.  We live in a woodsy setting on a lake. We have a fenced in yard which prevents the dogs from free access to the lake.  There are no sidewalks within walking distance, so the puppy will accompany me to town when I run errands or go to meetings, etc. for exposure outings.     As a sitter, I regularly meet with other local puppy raisers for socialization and play, or for their POD meetings.      I will be traveling March 1st to the 15th, but could take a puppy anytime after March 15th."

We live in a suburban single-family two-story home with a fenced in backyard and a nice park across the street.    Typically it's a push to get everyone out by 7:45am to schools and work. Mom stays at home but has enjoyed some free-lance work predominately in her home office. School is dismissed at 3, so the kids return by 3:30, but different days have different kids home at different times depending on the sports season. Basically count on 2:30-8pm being a carpool extracurricular extravaganza with some kids left at home to mind supper and do homework. It is a rare night that anyone but Dad is out after 8. Dad works hard, and often late.    Julianna, 15, is a ballerina with classes T & Th 5-7pm at the school at the end of our street. She is also active in her school's theater department so in the spring there will be one ""Tech-Week"" where all hands are on deck and we don't see her until 10pm. She is a serious student who really looks forward to a companion to be with her and her laptop during those long study sessions.    Katie, 13, had knee surgery this fall. She no longer needs a brace and can bend her knee. She will use crutches for only one to two more weeks.  She has physical therapy on T/Th for 1 hour, but the doctor has told her no sports this spring. He has given her the green light to get a puppy -- as long as it's not a ""big"" puppy. Already, the whole prospect of raising a puppy has brightened her outlook tremendously. She can walk the dog on sidewalks, but won't be doing any off-roading in the woods of our neighborhood park anytime soon.    Lauren, 11, is over scheduled -- especially in the winter months.  She does year round swimming with practices 5-6pm M & W; is on the school basketball team with practices on Th nights 5:30-6:30 and games on Sunday afternoons and a few Sat nights; and is also on the White Tail Ski Team which involves one parent driving her up and back on both Saturdays and Sundays. We leave at 7am and get back around 3pm.  Some weekends we don't go both days -- especially if it is raining and too warm. The other girls don't participate in this, so they will be home during this time. Even though Lauren is the busiest schedule-wise, she is the youngest, most affectionate, and most playful.  I have witnessed her taking the neighbor's dogs out for walks in the rain, and I know she will be loyal beyond belief to this dog. She doesn't realize this, but she really does need to be older than somebody (anybody!) else in the house. This is her opportunity to be a big sister, and I know she can't wait.    My daughters are all very excited about doing this. They were raised to be social-minded and believe in giving back. They just didn't realize it could be so much fun! I think there will be some over-zealousness in the beginning, but given the realities of our hectic schedules, things will settle down. They are going to cover each other when needed and divvy up the chores and pleasures of having a pet in a chart so that they can share the responsibilities and the love.    Upon further reflection, we think we would prefer to have a female dog -- after all we do specialize in girls!  As you know, our previous GEB dog was a Golden, so a GLAB would be welcome as much as a Lab. We know all about the hair getting EVERYWHERE, so with that in mind, yellow is our preference but not an absolute requirement. (Vacuuming is going to be an item on that chore chart!)    Re:vacations - we take two weeks off in the summer typically in August. One with each set of Grand Parents. Often, we do vacation rental by owner, and there is a possibility of getting a dog-friendly house if it is ok with GEB to bring the puppy with us to the beach/mountains in NC or maybe even the Eastern Shore. We are happy to host other dogs for puppy swaps as well as when other raisers have trips planned.      Since the high school schedule does not match the elementary school schedule, we will not be going away for spring break.  Instead there is a 4-day weekend in Feb for President's Day, and Daddy is in dire need of a vacation with his family.  Nothing is set in stone yet, but we would like to raise a flag that we are likely to need coverage for that time.    I am really looking forward to being a part of the GEB community again. Things have changed quite a bit, so the girls will be on top of me as to what the current methods are and correct my old habits. Already I have enjoyed watching my daughters take this responsibility with such seriousness and vigor. They spur each other on to do the readings, to puppy-proof not only their rooms but the whole house, and to campaign their Dad into getting the puppy in January instead of ""who-knows-when!"" later in the year.  It has been heart warming, and the dog isn't even here yet! Thank you for giving the Longs such happiness already."

My typical class schedule is 4 or less classes a day which amount to 1 to 6 hours of class with varying amounts of breaks depending on the day. I live on campus in a dorm room with a roommate. Each dorm floor has about 30 rooms with 5 floors in the building. During the school week (Monday-Friday) I do not work at a secondary job, my primary job is school work.  A puppy who is more quiet is preferable. On the weekends (Saturday-Sunday) I work at a dollar store away from school which entails me to stay at my house (Orchard Park) for those days and off campus. On average I can work from 4-6 hours on those days. Though I will be away from the puppy for those times, my mother, who has been taking the pre-placement classes with me, does not work and is home all weekend. I have been at the dollar store for 3+ years and usually have no problem working around my schedule for any reason. I do own 2 other older dogs at my house. The eldest is a 5 year old Coonhound. Though she is older, she can keep up with a little pup! The other is a 2 year old Cocker Spaniel/Pug mix who is a ball full of energy any time of day! I have worked out a plan with my roommate ( Brigitte Carrier-Auger) and my neighbor across the hallway (Jessie Burgess another GEB puppy raiser) for ""get busy"" breaks when I am unable to do so. Jessie and I have also arranged daily play dates to ensure the puppy will get the proper amount of physical and mental stimulation. My school's guidelines (Medaille College) is that the puppy must be 12 weeks of age and fully vaccinated before he can be on campus. Taking this into consideration, I would like to discuss the possibility of getting an older puppy (12 weeks of age) to expedite my raising experience. Thank you for this opportunity and I look forward to meeting my puppy."

A typical day consists of out the door around 630 across the drive way to the brake room where I will assign tasks to the 5 employees that work with me. I will than go about my business answering emails and check on progress on various projects. There are time where I will be  working in a wood shop. I do a lot of walking around the estate. I also do spend a lot of time in a normal week driving place to place to pick up supplies.  Every other weekend I spend with my 8 year old daughter. I also have her 3 days during the week. She is kind of low key kid not into sports or really running around a lot but there are times. I do like to get out and do some hiking during the summer, as well as camping.   One thing to note I am in the Coast Guard Reserves, which consist of going in to drill 2 days a month and 2 weeks a year. I am stationed in Suagerties NY so I am home nightly during my drill days. The average Coast guard day is form 7am to 1Pm most days but there will be a few days where i would be gone for up to 9 Hours. On that occasion I have would have one of the employees here at my everyday job let out the pup.   On most  evenings I spend either help do  home work or hanging out at home. On occasion i will go out for dinner. My house is a typical cape style. 2 floors. I have two out door fenced in dog runs that are very large. Those runs are occupied during the day with 2 Labs and 2 jack Russel tarrier until 3pm. Another spot on the property has a hound barn witch there are some walkers and Black and tans. All the dogs are Male with the exception of a few females. So my preference would  be Male, As for the color I don't mind either way.      Thanks   Matt"

I have a 1 hour lunch break, which I spend at home and am finished with work at 5. I return home after that time and run any errands (usually on foot) or participate in martial arts classes.   Once I have become a puppy raiser, I plan to rise at least an hour earlier to let the dog eliminate and then go on a long morning walk. My friend Lauren will also walk the dog  after I have gone to work and practice training exercises before my lunch break. During lunch the dog will be out of the crate again. After work, I plan to bring the dog on most errands (particularly once we have established basic behaviors). I live alone and intend training to be a constant and consistent endeavor. Once the dog can effectively Settle, I plan (and have received permission to) bring the dog to the office with me, for gradually increased amounts of time. Burlington is generally a dog-friendly city where the pup will undoubtedly be exposed to numerous other dogs, people, noises, surfaces and fast moving objects. I also happen to live in a part of the city in which many refugees are settled and a number of elementary schools are located. This will give the dog the opportunity to experience people from numerous nationalities as well as small children. Lauren works with children and hopes to bring the dog on visits to her after school program once the pup is ready to handle that amount of stimulation. I am open and eager to work with the Regional Manager to establish a relationship which allows for open communication and constructive feedback. I am looking forward to the opportunity to be involved in the mission of this organization and the chance to train a puppy with a purpose."

It is a co-op and I am the Treasurer of the Board of the Corporation which, in my building, means I do everything from paying the bills to escorting the exterminator around the building every month, to scheduling inspections and repairs of the boiler and elevator and. . . . well, you name it and in my building the Treasurer does it all!    My husband, Michael, will be raising the puppy with me.  Our neighbors, especially a teenage boy upstairs, all support our raising of a GEB puppy and help with the process.  We have five adult children between the two of us, none of whom live with us but we do visit each other when we can and the ""kids"" always love playing with whatever puppy we happen to have.  The actual raising of the dog, however, will be done by us.   Our apartment is on two floors and has an internal spiral staircase so early  on our puppy will learn how to walk up and down those stairs.   We have a large terrace which is a great space for grooming and playing as well. Michael has a full-time (9 - 5 )job whereas I teach flute lessons outside our home around 8 hours/week.  My teaching hours are flexible so clearly I am at home during the day more than Michael is.  I have rehearsals one evening most weeks and Michael will be taking classes at NYU two evenings/week.  We are planning to cover for each other during those times.  My day typically revolves around straightening up the house (laundry, dishwasher, making the bed), checking never-ending e-mail, dealing with endless co-op business (I am the Treasurer, remember?), my teaching schedule, practicing, rehearsals (and performances) and my commitment to going to my local YMCA for an hour's exercise every weekday.  I raised one other GEB dog and found it extremely useful to take him with me everywhere I could: the bank, Eileen Fisher (they love dogs there), the Gap, Gracious Homes, the Post Office, the subway, buses - basically everyplace except places that serve or sell food.  However, we even found an outdoor restaurant in Cold Spring, NY where we could take him right to the table with us.  Both of us will make a point to take the pup with us wherever we go.  We live near both Central Park and Riverside Park and anticipate many walks with puppy there as well.    Finally, we have a home in the Poconos, Pa which provides an entirely different experience for our puppy.  We have found that all dogs (we have sat a few in addition to raising Saxon) love to explore a new, much larger house and - the best of all - learning to swim in the lake that is about 100' or so from the back of the house.  Also, it gives us a chance to take the dog on a ride in the car (1 1/2 to 2 hours), something we city-folk don't tend to do as much as our suburban counterparts.    We understand the challenges of incorporating the care of a young puppy into our lives that are already busy with work, family and housekeeping commitments, but we both love dogs (we both grew up with dogs as pets) and look forward to integrating our new, very special, puppy into our lives.  As for me, I find it nothing short of an honor and privilege to be part of the process that will enable a dog to open the world to a visually impaired person.  Ever since I was in seventh grade, I was fascinated with ""Seeing Eye Dogs"" and seriously considered a career working with Seeing Eye in Morristown, NJ.  Now, several years (only several :-)) and several careers later, I am not surprised to find myself still fascinated by the intelligence and almost magical ability of guide dogs to perform their jobs.  I am grateful to enjoy my life as it is right now:  with my new husband, teaching & playing music, managing my small apartment building in NYC, and raising a dog for GEB.  I will do the best I can to enable our next GEB puppy to be the best guide dog he can be."

I am working on the concern about kids by taking him to the library (children's room), a playground and a farmers' market. He is not comfortable with physical contact with young children.  He has several types of barking: needs to get busy; don't know what to do with myself and am a little anxious; and demand.  He does not alert bark! He does most of his barking at work. He does not bark at home after work or on the weekends.  It is hard for him to spend a full day at work, even with an hour of exercise mid day. He tends to be barkier in the afternoon, but this is slowly improving.",,,,,26,,,,

Very rare ""mistakes"" are mostly my fault letting too much time pass if I get hung up in a meeting. He actually tries to hurry outside when I get back late. Most of the time, he makes it without incident. At home, he was housebroken and barked at the door once to let me know, on the second day I had him. ",4,"In over-excitement with other dogs around, he will get mouthy, but doesn't really bite like he used to.

He's brilliant when he's good and yet has to be removed from class or other dogs when he can't control his excitement. ""Approach and retreat"" seems to work to help him handle these times, and I'm highly hopeful it will help him get over his emotional response when dogs are around. Our new outside classroom should give us the room for approach and retreat. It's not about the task when he is over-excited...it's about having the patience and several strategies to help him through the behavior with his dignity and confidence intact. Troy is amazing...he's a very quick, smart, willing, affectionate, friendly pup with some challenging inconsistancies and over-excited reactions to other dogs, but we will work hard to get past those so he can put his talents to the best use.",,,,,26,,,,

My sister Carly has a schedule for collage that is different every day but also has work and other obligations. On the weekends we all have off so we either relax at home or go out shopping for various things, hang out with friends and family, or even go on a short trip (not likely) Also on Sundays we go to church in the mornings or at night. During holidays and breaks we usually stay home unless there is a planned vacation or a suprise vacation (also not likely)Summer schedule ~ Hope, Cathy, Carly have off from school and work and dad does not, yet takes off many weeks for vacation time. We all stay home for most of the summer, hanging out with friends and family, enjoying sports like softball(adult league), going to a variety of celebrations, going to church and church events, relaxing. The only planned vacation that should be worried about this year is our trip to camp hickory hill with friends, it is occuring in the 2nd week of August for about a week (don't know specific dates yet but will be arranged). We live in a medium sized house with a very large back yard and front yard. The back yard is where we spend majority of our time also includes an above ground pool. We have one house behind us and one house right next to us on one side and a church blocked by trees on the other. Live on a busy street but our house is far from the road.

My sister Carly has a schedule for collage that is different every day but also has work and other obligations. On the weekends we all have off so we either relax at home or go out shopping for various things, hang out with friends and family, or even go on a short trip (not likely) Also on Sundays we go to church in the mornings or at night. During holidays and breaks we usually stay home unless there is a planned vacation or a suprise vacation (also not likely)Summer schedule ~ Hope, Cathy, Carly have off from school and work and dad does not, yet takes off many weeks for vacation time. We all stay home for most of the summer, hanging out with friends and family, enjoying sports like softball(adult league), going to a variety of celebrations, going to church and church events, relaxing. The only planned vacation that should be worried about this year is our trip to camp hickory hill with friends, it is occuring in the 2nd week of August for about a week (don't know specific dates yet but will be arranged). We live in a medium sized house with a very large back yard and front yard. The back yard is where we spend majority of our time also includes an above ground pool.

She is very attuned to the emotions of the people around her and offers her support when she senses that something is not quite right. She is of lower energy and lower drive than most of the other dogs I have had. This makes her easier to work with and take places because she stays in think and learn mode more easily. Her socialization is going very well. One challenge I have with her is to keep her motivated and enthusiastic about her work. You can see this in class when she is much less cooperative at the end of class. Her severe food allergies make using high value treats difficult. A 40 minute walk is about all she is up for, even less on a day where the temperature is above 70 which she considers very hot. Lol  She is a very thorough, thoughtful sniffer û especially around dog smells. It seems like if she were left to her own devices that she would get lost in the smells and sniff endlessly. This is not much of a problem inside, but can be a problem outside. I have found that giving her clear direction about the sniffing is a good approach to take with her. Her mode of choice when we walk in the neighborhood is to walk to the extreme left of the sidewalk with her nose hovered about three inches above the grass. She has learned that IÆm not pleased with her stopping frequently to get a good long sniff anywhere, but this is her compromise so she can still enjoy the lovely smells but keep moving. I have taken to having her walk in the middle of the sidewalk where she will keep her head up better.  Nail clipping continues to be very challenging. She hates it so much. When I get the clippers out she tries to sweet talk her way out of it with wags and kisses. She will lay down for me and I can usually get one done (not always though). Occasionally, I can do another one, but more often than not, after cutting one nail, we have to backtrack almost to the beginning in the desensitizing small steps that lead to the actual cut. Many times she is just too nervous and will get to the point of not wanting to lay down any more. Again, without high value treats it is hard to find something very rewarding for her after getting a nail cut. Her best reward is to put away the clippers which usually gets a very enthusiastic response from her.  I have a note about her eliminating on command. Belva can go for a very long period without needing to get busy. With the dew on the grass and the sprinkler system going during the summer we learned that she does not like to walk on the wet grass. First thing in the morning taking her out I find that if the grass is wet she wonÆt leave the deck. If pick her up and take her out in the yard she stands there looking miserable and may even pick her feet up and shake them like dogs do when the pavement is too hot. The good news is that she can hold it just fine so I donÆt worry that this will lead to accidents in the house. She may, however, wait until the afternoon until she will go. Her record is not going until 3:00. Under normal circumstances, if I take her out any sooner than 6 hours, she wonÆt go. She may just lay down and look at me. So in answer to the question, does she eliminate on command, I have a mixed response in that she will go û if she feels like she has to - you have to be aware of how often she really needs to go out.  BelvaÆs food allergies are severe. I have emailed Dr. Sandler and got permission to feed her a food that is sold both at PetSmart and Petco. Luckily, I have found something that she tolerates pretty well. The huge problem with her is that almost all grain free foods use white potatoes in the formula. Belva is highly allergic to white potatoes (itching, chin acne, blood in her stool). I have been adding various foods that are ingredients in dog foods as a single ingredient added to her regular food to see exactly what she will react to. The choice of dog foods that she can tolerate is very limited and usually very expensive. I plan to continue to experiment with ingredients so I can give Dr. Sandler as much information as possible when she goes up for her IFT since this could be an issue for her as a guide.  All in all we are enjoying Belva immensely. She is a very nice, sweet personality to have in our home. ",,,,,26,,,,

We generally go the other direction to avoid the dog if possible.  If he sees another dog within about 10 ft. he jumps, leaps, barks and carries on until the dog is out of sight.  We will continue to work on this in hopes that the high value treats in combination with him getting older will calm him down.       Opa can not be left unattended with items on the counter or table.  He has taken glasses, a wallet, gloves etc..and chewed them. (Needless to say he has trained us to put everything away.)

For eliminating on walks I will stand outside for 20 minutes telling him to get busy and he won't go so I think he doesn't have to go and we start walking and we get half a black from the house and he goes. Like I said up in the section for comments the streets I walk him on are empty the majority of the time so I walk him down the middle of the road so he cannot sniff anything but he still goes. And he goes because he can smell everything from there anyway. He has a fabulous nose. I put him in his crate in my room and then go out to the kitchen and open a jar of peanut butter and not two seconds later he is barking because he can smell it and he wants it. When we play hide and seek I don't call his name anymore because he smells something of mine and then he tracks me. I did not teach him that he taught himself that.  ,,,,,26,,,,

There are some days when I work later in the evening but have flexibility to come and go throughout the day.  My husband works at home most of the time and our schedules can often complement each other.  I am a social worker in a not for profit agency and there can be occasions, when the puppy is a bit older, to bring him to work with me for brief periods of time.  We live in a private home with opportunities for the puppy to walk on various surfaces; meet canine and human neighbors and practice skills in various settings.  For exercise, we also like to walk in a variety of places (parks, urban, other neighborhoods) and will happily bring the pup along.  We like to go to Maine and Maryland to see our children every couple of months, on weekends when possible, and would like to take the puppy with us, if permitted.  We are somewhat social and enjoy having friends over for dinner or to hang out.  In addition, we host family and friends for several holidays, and some parties throughout the year.    We vacation in Maine several weeks throughout the year and hope to be able to bring the puppy there, too.

She loves working.,432,Primary,26601,0,6,7I14,Ingrid,2014-03-28 17:07:46,"Betker Family Life    Weekday Timetable: (FYI. James, Rosie and Mairead are all Homeschooled)    5:30 a.m. Dellie (the Papillion) wakes Bob (Dad Betker) to go out to go potty.  6:00 a.m. Bob gets up for work  7:15 a.m. Bob leaves for work  7:30-ish Colleen (Mom Betker) gets up. Let's dogs Dellie and Jessie (the pound hound) outside again. Mostly to check for squirrels.  8:00-ish James, Rosie and Mairead are woken up.  8:30-ish Kids come down and start getting breakfast.  9:00-ish Kids should be heading upstairs to shower and change.  9:30-ish Kids should be heading down to start schoolwork.  10:00-ish Kids are finally downstairs and starting on schoolwork.  11:30-ish Kids take a break and if they haven't already they will often take the dogs for a quick walk.  12:00 to 4:00 Kids work on schoolwork and take small breaks as necessary and get lunch when hungry.  4:00 p.m. Kids can use electronics for leisure  6:00-ish Bob gets home from work and family dinner is served. After family dinner dogs are fed.  Somewhere between end of dinner and 8:00p.m. Family gets together for prayers.  9:00 p.m. Mairead and Rosie get ready for bed.  10:00 p.m. Girls finally settled down and go to sleep.   10:00 p.m. James gets first call for bed, which means he goes downstairs for a snack  10:00-ish Colleen goes to sleep  11:00 p.m. James get lights out call (if still awake.) Bob let's dogs out for final time and comes up for bed.  11:30 Bob goes to sleep    Jessie and Dellie are let out periodically throughout the day on an as needed basis. (They let us know when they want/need to go out.) Mostly they go out to check the yard for invading squirrels or such.  Dogs sleep most of the day just waking periodically to check out what is going on in the house.    •	Jessie is our calm, happy, laid back 45 lb. All American Dog.  We got her from the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, when she was about a year.  She is now about 11 years old, but does not show any significant signs of aging.  She loves attention and is a real Daddies girl. (When Bob went to Iraq poor Jessie became very sad and melancholy, pining for her Dad. Thankfully she recovered once he returned. She loves to follow him all over the house as he does his chores on the weekends.) During the school day Jessie usually sleeps upstairs on whatever kid blankets have been left on the floor, or sometimes in the open kennel in the kitchen. Jessie mostly likes to snuggle on the floor with James at night. (Yes, James sleeps on the floor.  I think he does it now, just to get around the rule of, ""No dogs on the beds."") Even though she loves to be with James, she does make her rounds to each bedroom at some point during the night.  Jessie is what most people would die for in family dog.  She loves having her head and neck scratched, and when happy (which is most of the time) her tail wags a million miles a minute.  She also loves carrying the kid’s stuffed animals around the house.  She never chews on them or destroys them, just sweetly carries them around.  She also rarely barks.  In fact, she didn’t bark at all for the first few years, but now occasionally barks at critters in the yard.  She has also been know to hide behind trees waiting for the squirrels to come down so she can chase them off again.    •	Dellie, our hefty 13 lb. Papillion, on the other hand is feistier. She affectionately goes by the nickname, fuzz-ball and suffers from the typical small dog mentality; I'm really a Great Dane in disguise. Dellie generally stays downstairs during the school day with Mom and kids or goes to her post on the stairs where she can monitor anyone passing in front of the house while still keeping an eye on the family. (Dellie has delusions of grandeur and fancies herself the great family protector.) Dellie tends to bark a little, mostly when she sees someone walking their dog down the street or when someone comes to the door.  Dellie, although not hyper, is more active than Jessie, especially in the yard.  Rosie is Dellie's favorite person. They bonded early when Dellie figured out that Rosie typically left a trail of food wherever she goes.  Dellie, although not aggressive, does not warm up to other dogs instantaneously. Even though we have had a number of “foster” dogs through our house in the past few years, it still takes her a few days for her to get used to the idea of a new invader.  Once she is satisfied that the new dog knows she is top dog in the house she settles down.    Scheduled Activities:    •	Monday, Tuesday and Thursday we try (emphasis on try) to reserve exclusively for schoolwork. (But would also be flexible during this time to incorporate puppy needs.)  o	James has Boy Scouts on Monday evenings from 7:00 to 8:15.  (To accommodate this, one of the kids and Colleen will drive Bob to work in the morning. We will leave about 7:15 and be back around 8:30 a.m. Then at 4:30 one of the kids and Colleen will go back and pick up Bob from work so Bob has time to have dinner before taking James to Boy Scouts.)  o	Rosie and Mairead will take a Pottery class though Fairfax County Recreation from 2:30 to 4:00 on Mondays, from March 31 through June 2, 2014. James will stay home. (Might be an opportunity here for socializing.)    •	Wednesdays are our activities day and go generally as follows:  o	9:20 - Rosie, Mairead and Colleen leave for horseback riding lessons. James stays home to work on schoolwork.  o	11:20 - We swing by the house to pick up James and karate gear and head off for karate lessons.  o	2:00-ish - We swing by the house to drop off the girls and James and I head over to Fort Belvoir for his teen group meeting.  o	4:20 - James and I leave Fort Belvoir to go home.   o	(However, once or twice a month on Wednesday Bob and I go out for ""Life Counseling."" On those Wednesday's, once James and I leave Fort Belvoir, we will head to downtown D.C. to go pick up Bob from work. If it is one of the weeks to pick up Bob, we will then head home to drop-off James and then Bob and I go out. Kids fend for themselves for dinner, James takes care of the dogs and Bob and I return around 8:30.).    •	On Friday's the kids and Mom attend an educational co-op with other homeschoolers at Good Shepherd Church in Mount Vernon.  We leave the house around 8:30 a.m. and return around 1:00 p.m. The spring program ends May 2, 2014 and doesn’t resume until fall 2014.    •	Weekends are unpredictable. We do not currently have any regularly scheduled activities. So, on weekends we try to get the house cleaned up (or relatively so) and do any running around and errands that need to be done. Anything that will help reduce the strain on the weekdays. Dellie still wakes Bob up around 5:30 to go potty and check the yard, Mom still gets up around 7:00-7:30, but Bob and kids grab a few extra winks and tend to get up on their own somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00, 10:00 at the very latest. Bedtime tend to remain the same as weekdays.    •	Summer is also unpredictable.  In the past we have done swim team or other activities or camps during the summer, along with a quick excursion to the beach at some point.  In the past, we have also typically taken a family vacation to Vermont the third week in July.  This summer the only thing on the schedule thus far is Boy Scout Camp for James the second week in July. Kids seem to prefer the unstructured, low-key summer to those of the past.  (Bob’s father died over the winter and Bob used a good bit of his leave.  So we currently are unsure if we will be able to take a family vacation this summer.)    In the past I would have described our house as loud and active, but somewhere in the past year or so as the kids have gotten more into their electronics and started to headed towards their teens, both the activity level and noise level have dropped significantly.  So although Bob and I often feel like we are being pulled in several directions, overall house has slowed down.     Lastly, we have one daughter away at college.  She is 23 years old and is finishing her Bachelors in Sign Language Interpretation at Towson University in Maryland.  She has her own apartment and works full-time in addition to going to school.  Because of her busy schedule she doesn’t get to stop by the house as often as she would like.  Her visits tend to be two or three quick stops by the house during the week and then no visits for two or three weeks.  She is expected to graduate from Towson in the Spring of 2015 but will probably not return to the house to live after graduation.    Sorry about the length, being brief has never been my strong suit.  And you said, … “leave a novel.”"

We got her from the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, when she was about a year.  She is now about 11 years old, but does not show any significant signs of aging.  She loves attention and is a real Daddies girl. (When Bob went to Iraq poor Jessie became very sad and melancholy, pining for her Dad. Thankfully she recovered once he returned. She loves to follow him all over the house as he does his chores on the weekends.) During the school day Jessie usually sleeps upstairs on whatever kid blankets have been left on the floor, or sometimes in the open kennel in the kitchen. Jessie mostly likes to snuggle on the floor with James at night. (Yes, James sleeps on the floor.  I think he does it now, just to get around the rule of, ""No dogs on the beds."") Even though she loves to be with James, she does make her rounds to each bedroom at some point during the night.  Jessie is what most people would die for in family dog.  She loves having her head and neck scratched, and when happy (which is most of the time) her tail wags a million miles a minute.  She also loves carrying the kid’s stuffed animals around the house.  She never chews on them or destroys them, just sweetly carries them around.  She also rarely barks.  In fact, she didn’t bark at all for the first few years, but now occasionally barks at critters in the yard.  She has also been know to hide behind trees waiting for the squirrels to come down so she can chase them off again.    •	Dellie, our hefty 13 lb. Papillion, on the other hand is feistier. She affectionately goes by the nickname, fuzz-ball and suffers from the typical small dog mentality; I'm really a Great Dane in disguise. Dellie generally stays downstairs during the school day with Mom and kids or goes to her post on the stairs where she can monitor anyone passing in front of the house while still keeping an eye on the family. (Dellie has delusions of grandeur and fancies herself the great family protector.) Dellie tends to bark a little, mostly when she sees someone walking their dog down the street or when someone comes to the door.  Dellie, although not hyper, is more active than Jessie, especially in the yard.  Rosie is Dellie's favorite person. They bonded early when Dellie figured out that Rosie typically left a trail of food wherever she goes.  Dellie, although not aggressive, does not warm up to other dogs instantaneously. Even though we have had a number of “foster” dogs through our house in the past few years, it still takes her a few days for her to get used to the idea of a new invader.  Once she is satisfied that the new dog knows she is top dog in the house she settles down.    Scheduled Activities:    •	Monday, Tuesday and Thursday we try (emphasis on try) to reserve exclusively for schoolwork. (But would also be flexible during this time to incorporate puppy needs.)  o	James has Boy Scouts on Monday evenings from 7:00 to 8:15.  (To accommodate this, one of the kids and Colleen will drive Bob to work in the morning. We will leave about 7:15 and be back around 8:30 a.m. Then at 4:30 one of the kids and Colleen will go back and pick up Bob from work so Bob has time to have dinner before taking James to Boy Scouts.)  o	Rosie and Mairead will take a Pottery class though Fairfax County Recreation from 2:30 to 4:00 on Mondays, from March 31 through June 2, 2014. James will stay home. (Might be an opportunity here for socializing.)    •	Wednesdays are our activities day and go generally as follows:  o	9:20 - Rosie, Mairead and Colleen leave for horseback riding lessons. James stays home to work on schoolwork.  o	11:20 - We swing by the house to pick up James and karate gear and head off for karate lessons.  o	2:00-ish - We swing by the house to drop off the girls and James and I head over to Fort Belvoir for his teen group meeting.  o	4:20 - James and I leave Fort Belvoir to go home.   o	(However, once or twice a month on Wednesday Bob and I go out for ""Life Counseling."" On those Wednesday's, once James and I leave Fort Belvoir, we will head to downtown D.C. to go pick up Bob from work. If it is one of the weeks to pick up Bob, we will then head home to drop-off James and then Bob and I go out. Kids fend for themselves for dinner, James takes care of the dogs and Bob and I return around 8:30.).    •	On Friday's the kids and Mom attend an educational co-op with other homeschoolers at Good Shepherd Church in Mount Vernon.  We leave the house around 8:30 a.m. and return around 1:00 p.m. The spring program ends May 2, 2014 and doesn’t resume until fall 2014.    •	Weekends are unpredictable. We do not currently have any regularly scheduled activities. So, on weekends we try to get the house cleaned up (or relatively so) and do any running around and errands that need to be done. Anything that will help reduce the strain on the weekdays. Dellie still wakes Bob up around 5:30 to go potty and check the yard, Mom still gets up around 7:00-7:30, but Bob and kids grab a few extra winks and tend to get up on their own somewhere between 8:30 and 9:00, 10:00 at the very latest. Bedtime tend to remain the same as weekdays.    •	Summer is also unpredictable.  In the past we have done swim team or other activities or camps during the summer, along with a quick excursion to the beach at some point.  In the past, we have also typically taken a family vacation to Vermont the third week in July.  This summer the only thing on the schedule thus far is Boy Scout Camp for James the second week in July. Kids seem to prefer the unstructured, low-key summer to those of the past.  (Bob’s father died over the winter and Bob used a good bit of his leave.  So we currently are unsure if we will be able to take a family vacation this summer.)    In the past I would have described our house as loud and active, but somewhere in the past year or so as the kids have gotten more into their electronics and started to headed towards their teens, both the activity level and noise level have dropped significantly.  So although Bob and I often feel like we are being pulled in several directions, overall house has slowed down.     Lastly, we have one daughter away at college.  She is 23 years old and is finishing her Bachelors in Sign Language Interpretation at Towson University in Maryland.  She has her own apartment and works full-time in addition to going to school.  Because of her busy schedule she doesn’t get to stop by the house as often as she would like.  Her visits tend to be two or three quick stops by the house during the week and then no visits for two or three weeks.  She is expected to graduate from Towson in the Spring of 2015 but will probably not return to the house to live after graduation.    Sorry about the length, being brief has never been my strong suit.  And you said, … “leave a novel.”"

Mina has difficulty in class, I think primarily due the close proximity of people/dogs. Her connection to me is very fractured and she tends to lunge toward other dogs and people. I bring high value treats and take her out for play breaks, but the intensity is a lot for her.  Her behavior upon seeing other dogs when we're out is dependent on the distance and the behavior of the other dog. She wants badly to greet and sniff, but if they get too close she barks loudly and continuously. If we can approach very gradually, with lots of time to settle between steps forward and lots of rewards for checkins, she can sometimes be successful.

Most of our neighbors have dogs and cats as pets. Joppa Road is only 2 miles away, so we can quickly reach suburban and urban areas to provide the puppy with a variety of experiences. We have 3 grown sons who visit occasionally. I work from home as a consultant (computer work) with a completely flexible schedule, so working with the puppy throughout the day (and night!) will not pose a problem for me. I occasionally travel for my work, 1-2 times a year for a few days each time. Garry works at Union Memorial Hospital from 7 am to 4 pm on weekdays. We vacation for a week at a time perhaps once or twice a year. We have 2 adult dogs, 8-year-old Bear and 6-year-old Cocoa, who are Lab mutts. The dogs are trained to an electric fence around our property. We have installed a small fenced-in area (about 20 ft. square) that leads off one of the back doors of our house, so the adult dogs can play outside with the puppy safely (under supervision, of course!) before he is old enough to be trained on the electric fence. We have 4 adult cats who are used to the dogs. We usually walk the dogs twice a day for 1-1.5 miles each time. I will be able to walk the puppy separately until he is old enough to be walked with the other dogs."

We also have a fenced in tennis court where the puppy and I can train/play (after the snow melts).  On the weekends we live in a house with stairs.  The dead end road is quiet and we have woods with trails next to the property.  This switching of residences will end in mid-June when we will permanently leave the condo.

Even with the water bowl.  We are working on this everyday with him and my pet dog.  Kojak also has trouble playing nicely with dogs other than GSD Rodeo- He is very rough with his mouth and does not want to play TOY.   Kojak also really changes personality when wearing anything- bandana- jacket-tshirt etc- appears to be the BEST dog ever but is very unlike himself.  NO sniffing no blowing leaf chasing- only calmly sitting by my side.  We are working on that daily in familiar places to warm him up to the idea.   Odd note - Kojak is extremely ticklish- for lack of a better term- His leg goes when you scratch his jaw line and his back has 2 spots and his stomach and his front feet- when chewing an itch on his paws- his back leg goes nuts.,,,,,26,,,,

He's very affectionate, willing pup and seems to enjoy body handling.

For the dog we take them on an evening walk.    With a puppy we realize we have to change things up. I will take care of the puppy in the morning with feeding, getting busy and walk.

I'll start by saying that a lifestyle change is a definite possibility in the foreseeable future.  I am currently out of work and seeking employment.  I am a finance professional, which in this case means a couple things.  1. It may still be a while before I can get back to work.   2. Any work that I find would likely be in NYC, or southern CT, resulting in a commuting lifestyle.    3. The area of finance that I am in typically does not require really excessive hours except in unusual circumstances, so while a new job would mark a change in lifestyle for both me and a pup, it shouldn't be a change that prevented me from providing the proper care, enrichment, and training that the pups need.     In any case, all of that is speculative.  Right now, my lifestyle consists primarily of my ongoing job search and a variety of hobbies.  On a typical day, I will spend up to several hours searching for a job, half an hour working out at home, then add in some time spent on anything from trying to improve my Egyptian Arabic, dancing tango, or, weather and company depending, fly fishing, or squash.  This is aside from visits with friends and family.  As things stand, my entire schedule is rather flexible and my weekends differ little from my weekdays.      I live alone on the first floor of a two family house and have sole use of the basement as well.  The property includes a pretty generous back yard for outside play as well.  I am 31 and physically fit, so the physical aspect of working with a puppy (small or large) does not present a concern.   I do have a six year old cat, who has had some exposure to dogs and sort of likes to play with them unless they get too close or too aggressive.  He's never had a dog stay in the house for more than a month or so at a time.  I have a very close knit family, so multiple family members are very close by (and several are neighbors), in addition to my girlfriend who is following along with the GEB curriculum and policies and wants to be involved in helping out.   There are multiple dogs nearby in the family, all small, but also all very poor socialization, house manners, and ""people skills"".  The main things I want to make sure that GEB is able to work with me to get right are: socializing with other dogs (should the puppy be exposed to the poor untrained above mentioned dogs or avoid them to prevent being peer pressured into poor behavior?) and puppy proofing the house, in particular the basement (where the cat's litter is.)  Otherwise, the potential lifestyle change of a new job is the only item that could present a challenge.  I'm not certain what other information would be helpful for you, but would be very happy to discuss anything else you might like.    Oh, and question 4, regarding class schedules...  I didn't see the precise information on this, but I had been told six months of weekly and the remainder every other week.  Either way is fine as more training is better, in my mind.      P.S.

People can pretty much walk right over top of her and she will just watch them.  She is very, very alert and struggles to stay settled so we have taken her to church sunday school and coffee shops (both places where we can get up and move around/leave easily).  She stays fairly attentive to me, but wants to be entertained.  I generally bring a chew/bone with me so that she can focus on that and chew out any anxieties that she has.   Car riding is MUCH improved.  She recently starting loading on her own without treats, tori or us to lure her in.  I still heavily treat her with a carrot or a nice chew in the car.  Yesterday she traveled all the way to Cape Charles (1 hour) without any vomiting/salivating.  She did bark on the bridges.  Don't know if there was a difference in the sound the car was making or if she didn't understand why we were high above the water.  I was driving so couldn't really watch and figure it out.  The back seat is her preferred place to ride.  When greeting people when we are out she is usually fairly good.  Sometimes she'll try to jump but tends to be very well mannered.  At home it is a different story.  When she is excited she barks/sings and will jump repeatedly.  We have tried blocking her so she can't get at the person, we have tried blocking her with our knees she she jumps to deflect her.  We have tried holding her in a sit until she calms.  The holding her in a sit seems to be somewhat effective.  But there has not been any real improvement here.  She is highly, HIGHLY athletic and jumping is part of her expression of exuberance.  When out playing and given the chance to really run, she tends to bounce initially before she ""settles"" into that very streamlined graceful run that GSDs have.  We see a lot of bounce in her play with Tori.  Oksana is a fearless dog in a lot of ways.  It really doesn't occur to her to have issues with underfootings, heights etc.  She is incredibly intelligent and exuberant about most of what she encounters.  There is a silliness to her personality which is quite endearing (But in a refined GSD kind of way, not silly they way you see it in a lab).  And she wants to express everything she is seeing/feeling.  So we get a lot of alert barks about the world around us/her.  She will bark at Tori incessantly if Tori is playing with (or more likely cuddling with) a toy she wants.  When first let out of her crate int he morning or when we have been out there is a lot of squealing.  Its double the fun with both her and Tori are excited and fussing.  Her personality is quite lovely, but really her biggest issues are the (at times) incessant barking, the jumping and the play biting.  I feel like everything else is coming along and improving at a reasonable rate for her.",,,,,26,,,,

She has always been a big fan of my treadmill so over the past month or so I have been letting her walk on it. If she does 5 minutes or so, this settles her enough to be able to walk calmly outside. She is getting more curious, jumping up on the tables and counters. She doesn't take anything, just looks around then jumps back off. I've been working on this a fair amount and it is improving. She tends to be hesitant at first when she encounters something new but she is quite willing to explore anything with a little patience and encouragement. She is very well-behaved on outings for such a young puppy. We need to work on more outings where she stays still for a time because she has a tendency to grow impatient and bark sometimes. Other than the jumping and occasional chewing, her house manners have always been quite good.

I typically awake at 10am.  For both of our jobs, we work from home.  Both of us have appointments outside the home that we schedule, usually two or three times each day for which we are gone about two hours each time.  Rarely are we both gone at the same time.          He is a sales rep, I am a dog trainer.  I teach obedience classes, both private and group sessions.  Typically I will have two or three evenings each week teaching group classes for two or three hours each time.  I will work sometimes on Saturday, he does not.         We have two college-aged children who live at school during the school year and visit during breaks.  They have always had dogs.          My husband is having knee surgery next week.  He should be rehabbed within eight weeks.  Otherwise, we are both physically active.         We are very sociable people.  We enjoy going out to restaurants in the evenings, usually about three times per week.  We entertain friends in our home often, usually at least once per month, up to ten people at a time.  At Halloween and for the Kentucky Derby we have big parties, up to 30 or more people in our home.  For that reason, a less hyper puppy is probably best for these settings.         We have Browns season tickets and go to all of the games.         We have a swimming pool that our dogs enjoy with us.  We have a large fenced in back yard.         One of our labs is a female that has not been spayed because she has a heart valve problem and anesthesia could compromise her health.  She goes in heat every six months.

I typically awake at 10am.  For both of our jobs, we work from home.  Both of us have appointments outside the home that we schedule, usually two or three times each day for which we are gone about two hours each time.  Rarely are we both gone at the same time.          He is a sales rep, I am a dog trainer.  I teach obedience classes, both private and group sessions.  Typically I will have two or three evenings each week teaching group classes for two or three hours each time.  I will work sometimes on Saturday, he does not.         We have two college-aged children who live at school during the school year and visit during breaks.  They have always had dogs.          My husband is having knee surgery next week.  He should be rehabbed within eight weeks.  Otherwise, we are both physically active.         We are very sociable people.  We enjoy going out to restaurants in the evenings, usually about three times per week.  We entertain friends in our home often, usually at least once per month, up to ten people at a time.  At Halloween and for the Kentucky Derby we have big parties, up to 30 or more people in our home.  For that reason, a less hyper puppy is probably best for these settings.         We have Browns season tickets and go to all of the games.         We have a swimming pool that our dogs enjoy with us.  We have a large fenced in back yard.         One of our labs is a female that has not been spayed because she has a heart valve problem and anesthesia could compromise her health.  She goes in heat every six months.  Therefore, it may be better that we have a female puppy.  Our one male is neutered.  All of our dogs are well-behaved and very calm.  All have been around other puppies and dogs for extended periods."

They have 2 children...a 6 year old girl and a 1 year old boy. The ones in the building next to us is adopting an 11 year old girl this summer and they have a very obnoxious chihuahua. They don't leash their dog and I anticipate it being a problem at some point this summer. The folks across the street have a 3 year old Puggle and the unit attached to them have a beagle and a terrier and 3 cats. The cats are always roaming the neighborhood and the beagle is never leashed.     I am home all day unless I am doing errands...grocery shopping, pick up a script, stop at the bank, Dunkin Donuts for breakfast, etc. There is no reason the pup wouldn't/couldn't go with me everytime I leave the house. I volunteer at the local middle school on Thursdays and they have already said it would be OK if the pup came with me after he is house trained. My son has already checked with the high school and they have said he could have show and tell days there so the puppy if exposed to about 1500 kids moving in the aisles after each class.    We have a camp for the summer. We would take the dog to camp with us. The camp is right on the water so he could swim. We have a 60 foot dock and a boat which he could certainly ride with us.

We are at camp 4 to 5 days a week during the summer...mid-April to late October.    We are planning a cruise April 2013, usually gone for 7-9 days, so would need a sitter during that time.

He's always been a bit cautious, but would check things out in his own time. However, he's become scared of many sounds. For instance, he never minded the vacuum cleaner, but now he's spooked by it. I always make sure he has the opportunity to leave the room before I vacuum, and he always decides to leave. He may or may not check it out later when it's off and I leave it in the corner. A few days ago my son was playing with motorized hot wheel cars that run on a track. He heard the sound of the cars and ran out of the room into his crate. He's never been bothered by the cars before. We immediately turned it off and put it in a corner. My son has been playing with it when he's far away from Grant. Now Grant is not bothered by the toy at all and will walk next to it. He was troubled a few days ago when he heard the sound of aerosol stay can. W've been spaying it when he's far away from us, and he's clearly less disturbed. His reactions to noises are unpredictable. A heavy book recently fell close to his head, and he never even looked up (not bothered). He's not scared of traffic/construction noises. I think his fearfulness started when we were in a bathroom at a restaurant and a loud automatic hand dryer started. We left immediately. The sound of the dryer and air blowing profoundly affected him. He's an extremely calm dog, so it's easy to see when he's disturbed. He starts shaking, waging his tail, pulling his leash and whimpering. A few days after the blow dryer incident we went to a hospital to pick up medical records. He was fine at first and then became agitated. I still have no idea what spooked him (there was nothing obvious like a loud noise or unfamiliar object). Again, we left immediately. I haven't taken him into a building since that time. He stayed with an experienced raiser for 5 days, and she worked with him. She didn't find any specific triggers either. We've been hanging out in parking lots or shopping centers and walking in new places. He's great on those outings. At home we try to anticipate what will upset him and make sure he has the opportunity to leave the room.  He is generally good with under footings and will walk on most textures. He gets a little bothered if the under footing makes strange noises.   He can be indecisive. He understands basic commands and is compliant, but takes a few seconds to think through the process.   He's also a sensitive dog. He gets upset when we get upset (thin skinned). Therefore, we stay calm and never raise our voices. We give him tons of positive feedback.   His house manners are wonderful.   Anyhow, I'm trying to help him regain his confidence. He's a sweet dog with a great temperament.   ",,,,,26,,,,

We are both very active and do a lot of biking & running, so we are used to having to go outside in all kinds of weather.  Karim works at UConn (there will be some awesome socialization options on campus at some point!) and I work at the YMCA (about 10 minutes from home, so not far). Monday-Thursday I will typically be the one to get up in the morning with the puppy, before work, and then Karim will be home with him most days until noonish, and in the afternoon I will be home, or be able to take a break and come home for a while to let the puppy out.  We are both off on Fridays, so it is only four days during the workweek we have to juggle schedules a bit. We have a close friend who actually works on the camp property next door to the house who has said she would be willing to learn the process by which we are training the puppy, etc. (understanding that the puppy will need consistency) in case we need her to go over and check on him and take him out to get busy in a pinch. I frequently work late on Tuesdays, but we should be able to lay out our schedule and figure out which Tuesdays I can come to, which Tuesdays Karim can come to, or when we can go to another region on Saturdays if neither of us can pull off the Tuesday that week. We will be going out of the country for a wedding at the end of December and will need a puppy sitter at that time, for two weeks.

We have two school aged-children ages 6 and 9; our 9-year-old is autistic but likes animals; he is very active.     My husband and I both work from home. He does sales and customer service and is on the phone a lot; I'm a freelance writer so my job involves writing/working on the computer and some phone calls.    A typical day for us is waking around 7 to get the kids ready for school by 8. My son gets a school bus at the door, then one of us drives my daughter to school. We basically work from home until 3/3:30 when it's time to get the kids from school/the bus, supervise play time and homework, dinner, showers, getting them ready for bed by 9 p.m. We usually go to bed around 11:30 p.m.     Our weekends vary - sometimes a lot of social activity going on, other times not as much."

Amy's grandmother lives on the street, is retiring in June, and will be able to let the puppy out to get busy when we all return to school next fall.  We have two, female golden retrievers that are both 11 years old (they are sisters). These dogs are very laid back although they love to run around and play with each other when they are outside. When the weather is nice they stay outside all day as we have Invisible Fence installed. We also own sheep, horses, and chickens along with two parakeets. Amy will be going to camp this summer for one week and I have agreed to train the pup during that time. Amy's sister is going to be a high school senior next fall and we will be going on several college visits this summer that may include some overnights. Amy is in the Ag program and is interested in possibly bringing the puppy to school at times.  She would be allowed to leave the pup in a crate in the Ag department and go down periodically to take the dog out to get busy."

Edward is the prospective primary puppy raiser and Laura is the secondary raiser.    Ed is going through a life change and raising a puppy is part of the plan.  Ed is transitioning into retirement following a 40-plus year career working for the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.  It’s been difficult to decide when to retire, but the commitment of being a puppy raiser is making it easier.  Once the puppy arrives, Ed will continue with some consulting work from home, but the puppy becomes priority number one!    Laura is retired and was a bookkeeper and office manager for various companies over her career.    Our son lives and works in Ashburn, VA, approximately 1.5-hour drive away.  He has two children that live in Oklahoma City and they come to visit us about twice a year.    We do not currently own a dog, but have three cats.  We both love dogs, but our daily work schedules and Ed’s frequent business travel didn’t lend itself to proper dog raising.     Typical Day:  We both expect to be home most every day.  We typically get up early and go to bed early.  It normally starts about 5:00 am, workdays and weekends, and ends by 10:00 pm.  Ed usually makes most of the meals.   Ed plans to do consulting work at home during the morning hours.      Lifestyle:  Ed and Laura have a quiet relaxed lifestyle, that is, until the grandchildren visit.  We are both non-smokers.  Ed’s hobbies include bicycle riding and he spends lots of time working in the yard and on other home projects.  Laura’s hobbies include reading, especially mystery novels, and quilting.  Although she’s a cat person, Laura hasn’t met a dog she didn’t like.  She always enjoys greeting and playing with the Weimaraner who lives next door.    Work schedule:  Ed’s work plan following retirement will consist of consulting work from home averaging about 12 hours per week, with occasional visits to business offices.  The schedule is totally flexible.    Weekend schedule:  Ed and Laura’s weekend schedule is open format.  There are weekend shopping trips usually on Saturday mornings.  We attend church on a weekly basis.    Home setting:  Our home is in a residential community near Annapolis, MD.  The homes are on large lots (~2 acres) so there is plenty of open space.  There are many children in the neighborhood, the elementary school is nearby, and the school bus stop is down the street.   Most of our neighbors have dogs and there are many dog-walkers.  Our neighbors have offered encouragement and support for us becoming a puppy raiser.    What led us to Guiding Eyes for the Blind:  After not having had a dog for many years, the desire for a dog came to me (Ed) in a surprising way.  Several years ago on a bicycle ride in southern Maryland I came across this dog that I still think about.  At the time, I was alone on a rural road within sight of the Chesapeake Bay.  After making a turn at this scenic place, there was this chocolate Labrador Retriever standing behind a fence silently watching me.  I came to within a few feet of the dog, made eye contact, and connected with him/her instantly.  I thought what a beautiful animal!  I continued riding, a changed person.    Recently, several people brought service dogs in training to the office.  One of these people happened to be a dog-sitter for Guiding Eyes for the Blind, Montgomery Region, and I felt that connection again with her black Labrador Retriever.  I told myself, “I need to get one of these dogs.”  So here I am."

We live in a rural area so in addition to being with me each day at a PK-8 school, I'm trying to get her out to a different place each day to increase her experiences and confidence.",421,Primary,26667,0,3,8R14,Rhiana,2014-04-18 17:43:46,"I work in the main office for a private PK-8th grade school with about 325 students. In the main office area, I sit with a co-worker, Grace, who also has dogs and is willing to help me with the puppy when I have meetings or am involved with another student.  I have about 1-3 meetings each week lasting an hour.  Our school does not have a nurse, so Grace and I handle student illness, cuts, scrapes, etc. as well.  In the past, I have provided first aid, CPR and AED training.  Grace handles the cuts, scrapes, etc.  I tend to handle the big stuff such as administering an Epi-pen.  We also have a diabetic student which I help administer or test approx. once a day which takes about 5-10 minutes. The main part of my job is development work and is very flexible.  I have permission from our headmaster, Randy Hollister, to bring the puppy with me to work each day.  In our office there are 7-8 people who have additionally said they would be willing to help with the puppy.  I tend to work from 8:15-5pm.  I typically work the last two weeks of August until the third week of June and a couple of days in July.  The summer hours are 9am-3pm.  The puppy/crate would be by my desk, but out of the way.  I do not work in a classroom or have any set times that I am watching students.  However, I plan to take full advantage of having all these people around for the puppy to meet!    Our family lives in a rural area. We have about 30 acres which is mainly wooded.  We have 2 labs; Blackie has had 5 litters and we kept one from the first litter, Vader.  Both are females and not neutered.  Blackie is 12 years old and Vader is 9 years old.  Both have outside kennels and until this past cold winter, stayed outside all year around.  Blackie is slowing down and so we kept them in the kitchen area most of the winter.  We have an open floor plan but taught them to stay in the kitchen area.  With the warm weather, they are back outside all the time now.  However, the puppy would be with us wherever we are in the house.  We also have two cats, our mousers, Santa and Mrs. Claus.  They are also mostly outside except on cold winter nights.  Mrs. Claus and Vader are often seen licking each other!  Our cats are used to puppies and our dogs are as well.  We have not fenced in our yard, but have kennels and an extra kennel we used when we were raising Blackie's puppies.  When outside and not on a leash, we would use this extra kennel.  We are working to fence in our yard because of all of the deer in our area, but have only started that project.     My husband often works from home and will keep the puppy home when I can't bring the puppy to work. He has raised several dogs and is very interested to learn how it's done with Guiding Eyes.  Alex is a sophomore at Virginia Tech and will be home for the summer in May.  His plans aren't set yet, so we're not sure how much he'll be home for helping with the training.  Leland is a junior in high school and leads the NJROTC drill team.  They practice each day from 4-5pm. He also takes guitar lessons.  Leland is really looking forward to help raising the puppy.  Besides me, he will be doing a lot of the training.  He hasn't been able to take the classes because of his school exams, but I've been going over the material with him.    I work out 4-6 times a week, twice a week with a trainer.  He said I could bring the puppy there.  We do not generally go running, but if we do, I'd make other arrangements for the puppy.  The other workout times are at home in the morning or evening for 30-45 minutes.      I also volunteer for our church. We are considering expanding our facilities and I am on the finance portion of the building committee.  We meet after church on Sundays twice a month for about an hour and half.  I also help out with the youth group who meet Sunday evenings for a couple of hours.  We have often taken Blackie's puppies to them and to school for socialization, so they are used to this from our family!    On the weekends, I'm either running errands, playing in the garden, going to concerts (we are music fans!), or getting together with friends.    Most of my schedule and my family's schedule is flexible.  I don't see us having blocks of time when the puppy will be crated and alone.  If I had something going on at school, my husband would either work from home or take the puppy with him to his work.  He has a separate closed door office and a co-worker has one of our pups from Blackie.  My main concern for the puppy is being able to take the puppy to work with me each day in an open office area and being around PK-8th grade children.  I think this will work.  I know I will have to expand my hours a bit to do the training and bathroom breaks.  And I have taken several batches of 1-8 week old puppies to school for a few hours, but haven't taken a single puppy to work for several months and would welcome any suggestions!    We are all looking forward to this opportunity.  Thank you so very much for considering us!"

In the main office area, I sit with a co-worker, Grace, who also has dogs and is willing to help me with the puppy when I have meetings or am involved with another student.  I have about 1-3 meetings each week lasting an hour.  Our school does not have a nurse, so Grace and I handle student illness, cuts, scrapes, etc. as well.  In the past, I have provided first aid, CPR and AED training.  Grace handles the cuts, scrapes, etc.  I tend to handle the big stuff such as administering an Epi-pen.  We also have a diabetic student which I help administer or test approx. once a day which takes about 5-10 minutes. The main part of my job is development work and is very flexible.  I have permission from our headmaster, Randy Hollister, to bring the puppy with me to work each day.  In our office there are 7-8 people who have additionally said they would be willing to help with the puppy.  I tend to work from 8:15-5pm.  I typically work the last two weeks of August until the third week of June and a couple of days in July.  The summer hours are 9am-3pm.  The puppy/crate would be by my desk, but out of the way.  I do not work in a classroom or have any set times that I am watching students.  However, I plan to take full advantage of having all these people around for the puppy to meet!    Our family lives in a rural area. We have about 30 acres which is mainly wooded.  We have 2 labs; Blackie has had 5 litters and we kept one from the first litter, Vader.  Both are females and not neutered.  Blackie is 12 years old and Vader is 9 years old.  Both have outside kennels and until this past cold winter, stayed outside all year around.  Blackie is slowing down and so we kept them in the kitchen area most of the winter.  We have an open floor plan but taught them to stay in the kitchen area.  With the warm weather, they are back outside all the time now.  However, the puppy would be with us wherever we are in the house.  We also have two cats, our mousers, Santa and Mrs. Claus.  They are also mostly outside except on cold winter nights.  Mrs. Claus and Vader are often seen licking each other!  Our cats are used to puppies and our dogs are as well.  We have not fenced in our yard, but have kennels and an extra kennel we used when we were raising Blackie's puppies.  When outside and not on a leash, we would use this extra kennel.  We are working to fence in our yard because of all of the deer in our area, but have only started that project.     My husband often works from home and will keep the puppy home when I can't bring the puppy to work. He has raised several dogs and is very interested to learn how it's done with Guiding Eyes.  Alex is a sophomore at Virginia Tech and will be home for the summer in May.  His plans aren't set yet, so we're not sure how much he'll be home for helping with the training.  Leland is a junior in high school and leads the NJROTC drill team.  They practice each day from 4-5pm. He also takes guitar lessons.  Leland is really looking forward to help raising the puppy.  Besides me, he will be doing a lot of the training.  He hasn't been able to take the classes because of his school exams, but I've been going over the material with him.    I work out 4-6 times a week, twice a week with a trainer.  He said I could bring the puppy there.  We do not generally go running, but if we do, I'd make other arrangements for the puppy.  The other workout times are at home in the morning or evening for 30-45 minutes.      I also volunteer for our church. We are considering expanding our facilities and I am on the finance portion of the building committee.  We meet after church on Sundays twice a month for about an hour and half.  I also help out with the youth group who meet Sunday evenings for a couple of hours.  We have often taken Blackie's puppies to them and to school for socialization, so they are used to this from our family!    On the weekends, I'm either running errands, playing in the garden, going to concerts (we are music fans!), or getting together with friends.    Most of my schedule and my family's schedule is flexible.  I don't see us having blocks of time when the puppy will be crated and alone.  If I had something going on at school, my husband would either work from home or take the puppy with him to his work.  He has a separate closed door office and a co-worker has one of our pups from Blackie.  My main concern for the puppy is being able to take the puppy to work with me each day in an open office area and being around PK-8th grade children.  I think this will work.  I know I will have to expand my hours a bit to do the training and bathroom breaks.  And I have taken several batches of 1-8 week old puppies to school for a few hours, but haven't taken a single puppy to work for several months and would welcome any suggestions!    We are all looking forward to this opportunity.  Thank you so very much for considering us!"

She learned how to appropriately greet people which is hard for her exhuberant personality. However, she seems to show great anxiety when around dogs that she does not live with. She seems to be getting a bit better when walking the neighborhood. However, if in the presence of a dog or other dogs for any extended period of time, becomes overwrought and uncontrollable. Class is a perfect example in that she could not settle long enough to complete any task asked of her. Since she is a very strong dog, it becomes difficult for me to control or handle her. Imari also benefits greatly from repeated exposure to all new situations. She has been to lots and lots of places and various kinds of places and situations, and the more she repeats the same scenarios, the more confident she becomes. She is a great dog and I hope can find a situation that will work for her.",,,,,26,,,,

He will then have his meal and socialization time. I would walk him and then head to school around 10 (first period is a free block) at which point one of my parents is typically home. I return from school at 3:30, having allowed the puppy to have some crate time while I was gone so that my return would equal a walk a play, and taking him out to the nearest town where sidewalks, people, and distracts are present. I am very active, I love going out for hikes and being outdoors, as well as interacting with friends. We have an older dog, so a wild puppy would not be great, but one who would be able to go to soccer and football games with me and be okay walking in the woods and meeting new people. My weekends are always unscheduled so they are the most flexible. A male puppy is definitely preferred, and a yellow lab would also great based on past experience with the differing mannerisms.  I will be going to college next fall, so my mom and I are going to be sharing responsibility so that he will respond to her when I leave in 12 months."

We live in a converted town home (used to be one town home -- now it is four separate units (terrace level, first floor, second, and third)).  We are on the third floor (walk-up).  We have only a few neighbors that make up our building.  We live in Dupont which from what I can tell is a very pet friendly neighborhood.  Folks will not be surprised or annoyed of dogs.      Weekends are low key.  We have a car and like to go see places during the weekend.  I like to be outdoors.  I am someone who is very  active when there is a purpose.

Jerry gets home at 4:30 and I'm usually home somewhere between 6 and 8 (but a pup might be incentive to leave earlier!). Sunday mornings our schedule is church from 8:30 til 12:30 so we may need to adjust that for the first few months or so.   We have basically no experience with dogs. I have never owned a dog and this last day with Lil has been so enlightening and enjoyable! Jerry grew up with dogs but never had one on a leash before Lil. She is so docile and friendly. I've been really impressed with how well Gracie has handled Lil. I think she's going to do a great job with a puppy.  I wrote the info for our cat vet above. I'm happy to use whatever vet you recommend.   With this being Amy's first year at college, we will need to travel to Pittsburgh a few times. We would love to bring pup but it may be better to leave with a sitter the first few times. After the trip at the end of August we don't have plans to be away other than the college trips."

He has improved in the two or three months that we have had him, but he is still not an easy pup.   He appears to me to be rather insecure with new experiences - though he does improve with time and repeated exposure. He is highly reactive and this is getting worse lately. If I know someone is arriving, I can keep him focused and quiet, but if someone comes in the house unannounced or knocks on the door, Mathias erupts. He is also starting to bark at noises outside or even occasionally in the house. We do the best we can to redirect and get him focused, but it is not easy. His dog reactivity is getting worse as well. He is not aggressive at all, but highly reactive and barky when he sees another dog.  When out in public - interestingly - Mathias is very good. He is quiet and generally well mannered. I just started taking him into stores briefly and took him to church for the first time this past weekend. He was restless, but did better than I thought he would.  Overall, I find Mathias to be a rather odd mix of insecure, but bull headed and tenacious at the same time. ",,,,,26,,,,

We rise at 5:30 am and walk our current Australian Labradoodle (mini) Hannah Grace at this time for 45 minutes to an hour around downtown Westport. I leave the house at 7:15, my husband leaves the house at 8:00 am. I can arrive home for lunch at 11:00 a.m. (This is flexible, as I have someone who can let the dog out with some play time midday) Following my workday, I typically arrive home at 3:10 and on some days run errands with Hannah Grace who is  quite good in the car and settles when waiting between errands. I might visit the library or the gym or grocery store or visit a friend. We eat dinner between 5:30 and 6:30 typically. I attend Book Club once a week on Wednesdays and Guide Dog Training on Thursdays. On the weekends, we continue our morning walks in addition to a Sunday morning beach walk at Compo Beach in Westport where dogs are allowed off-leash in the off-season. I tutor a student twice a month who is fearful of dogs. Hannah Grace attends the session with me. In the summer, I co-teach a Literacy for Dog Lovers camp session at my home for 8-10 children (grades 1-6) for mornings over the course of two weeks. There are visiting dogs and guest speakers (Guiding Eyes!). The purpose of the camp is to help children develop their knowledge of dogs and understand the relationship they can have with a dog. Some children are fearful of dogs, are recent puppy owners, or are planning to get a puppy. Some of the children are special needs children. Hannah Grace is a Therapy Dog registered with the Good Dog Foundation and is scheduled to attend Read to Rover as well as anticipated visits to Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan.   We are very flexible on our weekends, usually hanging around the house and engaging in yardwork, gardening, and beachwalking . Our son who has Downs Syndrome lives with two roommates independently in Norwalk and we usually visit at some point over the weekend and bring the dog as they are dog lovers. We have raised 6 Golden Retrievers in addition to Hannah Grace, the last of whom passed on a year ago.   We live in  a house, within walking distance to town, that has a small fenced in area in the backyard behind the garden and patio. We do not take our dogs to the front yard and they are not allowed outdoors alone. We have many friends with nice dogs and periodically will have one stay with us overnight. (Golden Retriever, Australian Shepherd, larger Australian Labradoodle.)  We will be going on a vacation for one week in March and a second week in August. We typically take our dog in August. We have  our youngest son in college currently, and our middle son lives locally, all dog lovers.   I am working currently to explore my next career passion, with the intention of it including dogs and children. (One of my main goals is to be able to bring my dog to my workplace!) Because I am retired, I intend for my work to be part time."

He is the eleventh dog we have raised for GEB and the first to defecate in his kennel not due to illness (5 times as compared to say Omaha who had diarrhea due to Giardia). Jude will urinate in his kennel within 30 minutes of having been allowed to get busy and has indoor accidents when he gets excited. He seems very immature and highly distracted around getting busy. As a result, we do not consider him housebroken at 5 months. He did very well on his puppy sits and accompanied his two puppy sit handlers to work where they reported that he settled nicely and did not have accidents while with them at work but they also took him out frequently and never left him alone. They also reported that he barked a lot when put in his kennel in their homes (keeping one poor couple up at night) and that he had accidents at home which improved over time (both sitters had no other dogs in the home). We have learned that he cannot concentrate on getting busy unless on leash and away from the other older dogs. Despite being kenneled within two feet and in sight of the other dogs in their kennels, he barks every time he is kenneled. While he settles down after a while (receiving rewards and treats when quiet) he still has accidents. This has been a time suck for us (regular cleaning and deoderizing of the kennel tray) and has made us rather distrust him in the house (we have taken up some rugs to avoid soiling). Despite being taken out very frequently (sometimes about every hour if he has been playing or waking from sleep), he still has accidents. He will not be allowed to work indoors for another month at least.  Jude returned last week at puppy class from his last sit highly distracted and pulling badly on leash although the sitters said he had been easy to handle. It took half the class to get his attention, and even then he was highly distracted by smells. Due to his being bitten by a copperhead this weekend, the raiser had to keep his leash time to a minimum and has not had much opportunity to refresh his leash manners.  While we were once resolved to return him to GEB, we have decided that his sweet temperament; ability to settle calmly when alone and undistracted; and willingness to work trump the frustration of his extremely unreliable habits of elimination. We will also overlook our disappointment that like Omaha he seems cow-hocked and unlikely to be considered for stud even if we were to ensure he made his IFT. You know, having raised two broods, we'd really like to have a stud or two and some more grandpuppies to raise ... Sigh.  We think over time he will prove to be a sound dog and if medically fit then temperamentally able to handle the demands of working.",,,,,26,,,,

She loves to play with other dogs and is usually very respectful of them. She also enjoys keeping herself occupied with her toys. She has great house manners and I have left her alone (out of the crate) on numerous occasions with much success. On outings she is very well-behaved and I can trust her anywhere. ",,,,,26,,,,

These are our biggest challenges as we work to help her stay focused and connected when at class and when we are out walking or socializing.  Waffle has an absolutely lovely temperament, is overall very well behaved and has formed solid connections with each of our family members.  ",,,,,26,,,,

She is testing both me and the other dogs. She is no pushover. She is very smart and is a thinker and problem solver. However, what she considers a problem is not always what I consider a problem. It is fun to watch her wheels turn. She thinks she can talk and tries her best to communicate with me. She is very connected and tuned in.    The major thing we are working on is having her settle while I disconnect from her. She would prefer to keep moving, and if we arenÆt moving that I at least engage her and feed her treats. She considers æsettlingÆ a problem that she would like to fix. She is making good progress though. She is now letting me sit and disconnect without doing all kinds of behaviors to get my attention. She still doesnÆt lay down and settle for long without getting ansy, but itÆs a process.     Jenny walks well in all environments and shows good confidence. She is fabulous with noises and has very low small animal distractions. She is great around other dogs and children. She is observant and pays attention to her environment. IÆm very excited about Jenny because she has some real potential to be a fabulous guide.  ",,,,,26,,,,

We work from home, so the puppy will spend part of the day in my office and part of the day in John's office.  Some of that time will be in the crate and other time will be spent practicing skills at my feet while I work.  Working from home allows flexibilty to take puppy out to get busy starting every 30 minutes duing house training and then working towards fewer times a day with maturity.  Puppy will have mid-day play time and lunch.  Puppy will have more play time when the kids come home from school at 3pm. All play time will also be used to reinforce known skills.  Puppy will continue to have appropriate busy times.  Dinner will be between 6-7pm and bedtime is between 10-11pm.  Puppy will go with us to any outdoor activities like tennis or lacrosse games.  Puppy will also be taken out in the evenings to settings that are appropriate tot he puppy's ability level.  An example would be a small shopping plaza bench, or a park."

From New Jersey I am commuting everyday to a 10 week program Internship in New York City down by the World Trade Center. My job is 9-5 with an hour lunch break. When I arrive home around 630 I normally cook myself some dinner and relax at home for the rest of the night or go out to meet friends. When I receive my puppy, however, I will be already moved into my new house at my college, Marist in Poughkeepsie NY. I have my own room and everyone who is in my house (5 girls) is excited and anxious to meet the new puppy and help in any way they can with the process of becoming a Guide Dog. I scheduled my classes purposely in anticipation for my puppy needing a lot of my attention. I scheduled 930 AM classes so that I will have time to tend to my puppy in the morning, and then 2:00 and 3:30 classes so I have time for lunch and play time. When I am not at class I am on the executive board of the largest social group on Campus called Campus Ministry. We every last Sunday and first Monday of the month for meetings in addition to any extra fundraissing events we do on campus for local food shelters or homeless shelters. I have received the approval of my campus to allow my dog to come with me to classes and anywhere else I may need to get to (pending the pup is ready for those experiences and what the Guiding Eyes deems as acceptable places for him to be). I also am the President of Fox P.A.W.S (People for Animal Welfare Society) and this will have monthly meetings on Wednesday nights as well. On a more day to day business, after my classes (the times I have posted above are the same Monday-Thursday I have a 3 day weekend) I normally will make myself dinner at home around 530-6 and then hang out around the house or take a walk on campus down by the river. I normally go to bed around 1130-12 depending on the amount of homework I have. I have been waiting in anticipation for this puppy for so long. Everyone on my campus, including the administration, is aware that this is going to happen and are fully supportive of anything that I need or Guiding Eyes may want of them. Thank you for giving me this oppurtunity!"

No aggression at all. Loves to play and interact with other dogs.  In my opinion is a bit slow in maturing mentally. In the past few weeks have seen him increase his attention span, and maintining his focus on handler.  With the exception of three bouts of pano, he has been a very healthy pup.  Loves to be with people. He is extremely good in his crate in the house. Gets along very well with family dogs, ""respecting their food bowls, and not poaching""  Our small family dog can climb all over him, even when sleeping and it does not phase him.  He has been a vocal pup since we first got him, but that is improving, but not totally resolved. Does bark at unfamiliar dogs.  He does not sniff the ground excessively. Very solid on all types of flooring, surfaces, stairs, and in elevators. Does very well when boarding and exiting public transit busses, and rides very well in cars. Does well around shopping carts, and disabled persons in wheelchairs. Does well in shopping malls, with his focus increasing as he ages.   ",,,,,26,,,,

The kids get come home from HS at 1:30.    We eat dinner around 6:30.  In the evening, i used to walk Tilden or we would go to malls.  If the kids miss the school bus, or need  a ride, Tilden would come.  If I went to work off hours Tilden would come.  we took Tilden camping with us.  The weekends are walks, outdoors time.

It is possible that I will be getting another part-time job for the mornings. If I do get the job I would be able to take the dog out before I leave for work and come home for lunch. My husband does travel occasionally for work but we have planned for me to be the primary trainer. He will always go to the classes ect. with me that he will be home for. We also just found out that he is going to be sent to Australia in November and I would like to go with him. If I am able to go with him we would be gone for 2-3 weeks. We are very excited about being puppy raisers and are prepared to take it very seriously :)"

I attend a Bible study on Tues. mornings and then work for about an hour in the church office. I go to a 2 hour choir practice on Wed. evenings. Sunday morning we go to Sunday school and church. Once the other GEB puppies that we have had have been housebroken, we have started to take them to these events so that they have learned to settle quietly for long periods of time. Most of my days are relatively unstructured. My husband works 4 10 hour days/ week. We have 4 other families that we get together with every month with children ranging from 8 years up to adulthood. I like to take walks. We enjoy camping and kayaking. I have family 5 hours away that we travel to for the major holidays."

Required us to use patience and wait for her to respond at times.  That said, at times when she becomes excited, she self-modulates which is very cool.      She can be olfactory including mild air scenting especially walking in small towns where dogs have eliminated on every object.  Increase use of you, faster pace, high value rewards somewhat help.

After i finish my SAT prep I usually have the rest of the weekend. My weekends and afternoons are very flexible. I live in a house with a large backyard, with woods in the back. The dog i currently have is a 2 year old Morkie. he is well behaved when home alone he follows me around the house and doesn't like to leave my side. when i am doing my HW he always lays right next to me or in his bed near my desk. Outside he is very well behaved he stays in our yard and loves to play fetch once the ball is thrown he always receives it and brings it back to me.

I am a substitute teacher in the public school system, work very infrequently, less than once a week.  My husband works from home on fridays and that is the only day I make myself available for sub work.  We have never had a family pet before.  3 children living at home  Jessica will be 20 in October.  She had a true dog phobia as a child and has worked hard to break herself of that ""embarrasing"" condition.  Still not   100% but Jodi is working with her and she's been to every class so far and is excited to be participating.  Oliver will be 13 this summer.  Oliver describes himself as an indoor person and was turned off by the smell of the treats and slime on his hands at the last training session, his first intro to treating!  he had to wash his hands half way thru the session.  He is very excited about being a trainer however and he and his brother have been begging for years for a dog.  He is very smart and is well aware of the commitment and the requirements - lots of going outside - and is still willing to be a part.  John will be 11 this summer.  A little nervous around bigger dogs ever since he recieved a long red scratch that broke the skin down the entire length of his back when a friends large dog jumped up on him to greet him about a year ago.  He is very excited about participating and is a real outdoor boy.    We are very active in our church, which is half an hour from our home.  Sunday morning we leave the house before 9 and can return by 12:30ish but twice a month we go out for lunch afterwards, every other month we have a fellowship meal at the church building  followed by a meeting for committees that Jose and I are part of (Jose is a deacon and has more meetings than I do.)  We will probably be able to bring the puppy to the building with us most times when we need to.  Jesica doesn't go with us very often becasue she works on Sundays (Kohl's) so she may be able to take care of the puppy depending on her schedule (sometimes she goes in at 9 on sundays, sometimes 12.)  We go home, Jose and I take a nap and the boys finish up any homeowrk then it's back to church again in the evening leaving about 5 and returning about 8.  I teach John's class on sunday nights and can have the puppy in class with me.    Monday thru Thursday I am home most of the day, usually doing all my errands on monday.  Oliver and John usually have after school sports and clubs after school Monday thru thursdays.  Fridays this year were arranged visits with a friend for John, so every other weekend he had a friend over for an hour after school.  Saturdays the boys often spend in their pajamas!  Or we go somewhere, festival or something.    We live in a townhouse."

Usually Cleo and I then go for a 3-4 mile walk.  We pick Tom back up around 5 pm as he works Monday through Friday.  The rest of the time for me is busy with sewing, gardening, and other unscheduled activities.  I do have grandchildren in town so I do attend some of their activities. On Wednesday afternoons Cleo and I go to Northwest Hospital to visit patients, and in the fall I will be teaching a class on Fridays.  I usually go to lunch once a week with friends, and naturally the usual grocery shopping and other such excursions.  Our weekends are usually busy.  In the summer we have a summer home in Barton and spend weekends with family up there.  The rest of the time we are in Milton.  We have quite a few family get togethers."

If she is not approached by people, she will sit and watch, but if they approach her she will get very excited and jump and ""mouth"" them.   She only countersurfs if there is a ""sweet"" dessert on the counter. She ""pulls"" sometimes on leash and doesn't always obey ""come"". But, she is also smart and loves to be with people.

On a typical day Terry will get up first, take the puppy outside to get busy, feed the puppy, and then do some training.  Terry will take the puppy to work with her, frequently taking him from his crate for training and exercise.  Ann will work with the puppy after school and in the evening.  Bill and Terry will work with the puppy again in the evening, taking the puppy for a long walk before bedtime.  We have another dog, Frampton, a 3/4 Golden Retriever 1/4 Poodle mix who is a seven year old male who expects to be walked and played with daily.  Frampton is not particulalry good with other dogs, usually barking at the initial meeting.  However, he does settle down quickly and accepts the other dog.   We live in a two story house in the Village of East Aurora.  We have a large kitchen/family room where we spend most of our time.  This area is closed off from the rest of the house which will make it easier to monitor the puppy's behavior.  Our location in the village will allow us to have many socialization opportunities.  We are all in good shape physically so will not have a problem exercising the dog.  We plan on taking him to local parks and for hikes.  Terry's parents are in a senior living facility and she stops by to check on them frequently and will be taking the puppy with her.  We are concerned that there is not much diversity in our village, so we are planning on taking the puppy into the city for more socialization activities.    Ann will be leaving for college in August and Bill will be away for a five week period in late May and June."

Our schedule vary in a way where there is always someone home or someone able to take the puppy with them.  After graduation, I will be looking for a job change but I am keeping to dog-related jobs.  I hope in another year or so I can open my own business depending on the area where my husband can find a job (the job will probably not be any farther than an hour drive from our current location.  A baby is a possibility over the next two years depending on how things work out after graduation.    Typically once a month we drive to visit family in a city that is an hour drive."

I try to run just about every day, three or four miles, outside weather permitting and I go to the gym several times a week.

A typical school day would consist of a couple of hours of classes, at most two consecutive hours, so that I am allowed breaks in between classes for puppy time. However, I plan to work as well, so that might take up at most four hours one or two days a week. I will be living in a dorm room on campus. Periodically throughout the year I will be traveling home to NJ, and during these breaks from school my schedule will be more flexible and the puppy will have a house rather than a dorm room and hallway. I plan to associate with the NYC region during these times.   Because I live in a dorm with many neighbors, I would probably need a puppy that isn't very fond of yapping.    I look forward to the rest of my journey as a puppy raiser/sitter!!"

I usually take a walk around 8:00 a.m. before heading to my job as a preschool teacher at a local Nature Center.  I am usually home by 1:00.  I sometimes take a walk before my kids get home from school at 3:00.  We do homework from 4:00-5:00 p.m. Dinner is usually around 6:00.  We usually take an after dinner walk or play outside around until 7:00.  Bedtime for my kids is by 9:00 and I am in bed by 10:00.  I am married, but my husband is gone most of the time for work, so it's just me and my girls during the week. We just lost our beloved 13 year old yellow lab (who was a service dog trained through the Delta Society) in October, but we somehow still stick to his schedule with the walks, etc.  Sometimes habits are hard to break! I don't work during the summer, but sometimes I do kids day camps here and there.  Our entire family is home for the weekends and I pretty much stick to my walk schedule because I love being outdoors!  We are very lucky to live in a wonderful neighborhood with plenty of dog owners.  We have the Cleveland MetroPark system, Lake Erie and a man made reservoir all within walking distance from our house! We do have 3 cats, but they are used to being around dogs because of ours and others that we dog sit regularly.  (Even as I am writing this, I have a black lab and 2 Bernese Mountain dogs laying at my feet!) We would love to become puppy raisers by the end of May or early June of this year (2012).  We would prefer a yellow lab, but the gender does not matter. Thank you for your consideration!"

I think the energy is something he will grow out of and he will be a great potential guide dog as he is very intelligent and observant. ",,,,,26,,,,

Currently I have chosen to avoid these situations and am now concentrating on several areas where he may benefit from improvement: 1-getting/playing with toys; 2-calmly greeting guests at home; 3-sitting and waiting at doors, especially when leaving rooms and going outside to play; 4-coming when called when off-leash; 5-polite play with our dog. I am trying to be really consistant and he is responding well, especially waiting at doors, even when our dog charges through, and coming when called. I finally found a toy he likes and we have been practicing a lot of 'get a toy' and fetch. ",,,,,26,,,,

We are looking for advice on how to introduce the two to the new pup and are looking for advice for them to get along.  Potentially a puppy that is not known for chasing would be helpful because our cats are currently very active in our home    Though the pup will be supervised we do live on 1/3 of an acre - with a large fenced in backyard.  We live in a small neighborhood but close enough to the town of New Milford to introduce the puppy to sidewalks and different sights and settings"

When he does this I do not pressure him into going up the stairs but if someone he knows walks infront of him and encourges him to come then he will do them quickly.  Not sure what he is afraid of here, when he was a little pup he loved going up and down the stairs at school with me no problem.  This also occurs in the parking garage, he will not go close to the stairs but some days he enjoys going up and down them.  A few days ago i brought him into a new space where there were stairs up or a door to the side, we were going to the door to the side but once he saw the stairs he did his backup laydown ""i am not moving"" Not sure how to help him on this besides giving him the time to check out the stairs on his own time with no pressure.",4,"Will sit most of the time with the verbal command, in busy situations or lots of activity you may need to tell him a few times along with the hand motion right infront of his nose",4,"Same as 80, he does great usually, in busy situations or lots of action going on he may need extra encourgement",4,Been practicing this in busy situations and he has been getting alot better.

He has an office inour home and does travel some to do inspections within a couple of hours of Norwalk if necessary possibly 2-3 days a week. He can be gone from a couple of hours to all day. His schedule is very flexible and works around the kids and Lori when it is necessary.    Lori is a substitute teacher for Norwalk City schools. She either works half days or full days depending on what is needed and can be flexible depending on Mikes schedule and the kids. Usually at the beginning of the year I do not work more than 2-3 days per week if that and most of them are half days.    Collin is 15 and starting high school this year. He will be up by 6:30 (and Lori) and and be done by 2:30 so he will be in charge of early morning :)  Dylan is 11 and will start 5th grade. He leaves at 8am and gets home at 315 pm so he can do morning later and afternoon.  Both boys are in fall sorts but they do not happen until later in the evening and they are staggered so we will be running but that means we can be home with the puppy or he can go with in the car for pick or drop off. Most of their activities happen in the evening or on the weekends which will be incorporated ibnto oru lifestyle with the puppy. it will be a learninjg experience for all of us. !!! :)  I would say our family is pretty laid back we our spontaneous at times......if you need more info or have any questions please just ask us.

Classes are weekly and we have not missed any in the last 3 months but a class or two may have been canceled in that time. 97. Her behavior in class varies from week to week. Some weeks she does very well and is happy to work with myself or whomever is working with her. Other weeks she is much more interested in the other dogs or whatever else is around to divert her attention and has absolutely no interest in working with anyone. These weeks in is extremely difficult to bring her back and most of the class is spent just trying to get her to focus. ,879,Primary,25138,0,26,5T312,Toffee,2012-09-21 19:48:35,Weekends are pretty flexible and usually free. I have classes from 2:35-6:40 on Tuesdays and Thursdays but can find time between them to take the puppy out to get busy and just get out of the crate for a bit. I also have a class from 9am-11:40 on Wednesdays and Fridays and one other class from 5:25-8:05pm on Wednesdays. I currently work on Wednesdays from noon-3:30 and on Mondays from 10:45-7:30 though I am currently looking for someone to take over my second half of that shift so it will not interfere with the puppy classes. I have a secondary job but the hours vary and are flexible to my schedule. I go to Ithaca College and I live on campus in a single dorm room. I will be leaving the area for Christmas break which is roughly a month and over the summer (about 3 months). I live about 2 hours from Ithaca.

I included notes from her previous raiser and RM Nicole as a baseline:    - Her name response is great!  - She has average energy and can get overwhelmed in too busy of an environment for her.  Raiser lives in a quieter area of Manhattan if that is possible and Guava does well there.  When there was a bike race in her familiar area she became overwhelmed and needed to take it slow.  - She is reported to have minor crating issues but the raiser lives in an apartment complex and has never had any complaints.   - She went to the beach on a long line and tended to pick on the younger shepherd that was with the group.  - She gets excited about people rather than dogs.  She can self modulate well but needs to work on greetings.   - There are two short videos of Guava playing with GEB pup Karat (11 wks old) and then GEB Mandrake (8 mos. Old).  Guava initially played well with Karat for about 5 minutes or so and then Guava started grabbing on KaratÆs neck, ears, etc and was being very rude. We separated the dogs but Guava kept going back at Karat.  I then had Guava play with an older dog (Mandrake) and they played very appropriately with a toy for about 10-15 minutes.  Not sure if your potential raiser has other dogs at home but I thought I would share that info in case it mattered.  - The biggest thing that I observed about Guava is her noise sensitivity.  As youÆll notice, where we were filming was a pretty busy area in Manhattan with lots of cars and general noise.  Guava seemed fine with this constant noise as she was able to work well with Julia but she was definitely very aware of all the sounds around her û her ears moved around a lot.  There were a few moments when she would hear a sudden loud noise (a motorcycle for example), which would cause her to startle/rush a bit but she seemed to have good recovery.     In comparison to her previous evaluation, not much has changed.  The following is what I am seeing now (one month later):  - no crate issues  - attention barking just for a few minutes when left alone where humans and dogs are insight. Then will settle quietly.  - makes ""bunny ears"" (ears straight back and laying against head) when alarmed by loud sudden noises.  Recovers quickly and will re-approach objects emitting noise  - No prior history was mention about body handling.  That is one big thing we noticed immediately when we first got her. She does not like to be restrained.  Specifically when rolled on her back, extreme stiffening of her body.  - But oddly enough, will allow you to handle and hold her toes during nail clipping.    - Is unforgiving for quite some time after being released from being restrained.  - have found food does not work as effectively since food gets her too aroused thus adding more stress  - have found successful progression with doing many frequent quick ""catch-and-release"" method of restraint  - very rude dog play with Brady and Anders, lots of neck biting.  But plays respectfully with older dogs like Leonardo, Ensign, Champ  - I take her to my Dulles Gateway puppy class and she interacted and played politely with the other puppies. She is able to work with any handler. She is an amazingly quick study!  - loves riding in crate in the car  - knows her behaviors  - on socialization outings, super well behaved and responsive to name and loose leash and settling  - good energy level.  Requires average level of exercise and low energy level indoors.  ",,,,,26,,,,

Our home is calm and quiet; pretty orderly and clean.  We laugh a lot, and we are prepared for major puppy disruption!   We are both very recently retired, still adjusting to the blessing of free time!  Bernie still does part time consulting occasionally, from home.  I might look for something part time, close to home, but have no immediate plans.  We expect to be home, at least one of us, most times. We travel only occasionally, have lots of hobbies and interests.  Gardening, handcrafts, woodworking, church, community involvement, etc.   We usually get up early (even earlier with a pup!), and have a neighborhood where we can walk safely, which we do often.  There are no sidewalks, but most areas are very safe for walking. We do our usual chores through out the day, walk to get the mail from our post office, sometimes go out to eat, but also like to cook/bake and eat at home.   We have nice family gatherings from time to time, home and away (nearby).  We are fortunate to live a happy and peaceful life, and look forward to the opportunity to successfully raise an impressionable young dog and teach the basics it will need to provide such an important service later in it's life.

Val particularly commented on her lovely house manners.  When she plays with Pixel, they can both get snarly faced, but Karise responds well to ""toy"".  Her training has been interrupted recently because she had a split heat and was out of action for six weeks.  We still had play dates with Pixel, but she stayed home the rest of the time.  We've started back up this past week, and she's doing well.  I'm concentrating on multiple small slices of various experiences.  We had our first extended walk in the woods today.  Alleluia!

During the week JJ works in DC and typically leaves the house around 5:45a so he can take the puppy out to get busy early in the morning before he leaves for work. He returns home around 4:45p. Occasionally he also has the opportunity to work from home. The first half of this year he has been involved in a lot of travel for work but due to the program he will be home a lot more starting at the end of May. Rachel has a more flexible schedule and is able to work from home a majority of the time. She typically goes into her office either in DC or Alexandria, 2-3 days a week for 6-8 hours. She doesn’t leave until 7:30 so the puppy will be out again, fed, and let out a final time and crated before she leaves. When the puppy is ready, it will go to work with her on those days. Prior to that, our neighbor’s son, who will be home on vacation from college, lives ¾ mile away and will be available to let the puppy out and feed between 10:30-11:30. Rachel is usually home by 2:30. In the afternoons/evenings during the week we tend to stay low key with an occasional activity one or two nights a week. We will go to the gym or go on a run in the park. Although we will have to be more conscious of our timing, we do have a 5 year old German Shepherd (Harper) who we have make sure gets adequate exercise and try to incorporate her into our plans as much as possible (As we will with the puppy). On the weekends, we stay fairly busy however we are lucky to live in a very dog-friendly town where even pets are welcome out and in stores. We enjoy taking Harper with us hiking, to the park or to the beach. We do like to take weekend trips once or twice a month but when we do travel, it is normally no more than three hours away and we normally take Harper with us. We live in a single level ranch home with a finished basement (with carpeted stairs). We do have a fenced in back yard with a 6-foot wooden fence which will give Harper and the puppy room a safe area to run around and play."

He also will jump during people greetings so since coming back on campus we have been working extensively on that. We have taken him to a few stores/restaurants (with permission of the owners) and he has done magnificently! He will settle very well and is very good at doing commands there.

This is my first GEB experience.  I love animals and I have always had them but never have structured their environment in this fashion.  I am learning alot with Ames.  I am certain he is a very smart dog.  I am certain he has a super personality.  He loves to please and he loves to be connected.  He is a lover.  He always has a smile on his face and he gives love constantly.  I have noticed that he loves the outdoors.  He would stay outside all day in any weather if you let him.  He also loves to work.  When we are in class he is very happy and he does not like to end that experience.  He knows when it is over and his body language will change and he gets a sad look on his face.  He also loves to smell things and he has a very keen sense of smell.  Sometimes he is more distracted by smells than by other animate objects.  If Ames makes it through this program I would like to say now - in case I don't get the chance to later - I think he will be happiest with a person who is very affectionate and who has a true love for him and will hug him and talk to him and pet him constantly. Ames is just a lover.  Sometimes he will go up to Clementine when she is sleeping and he will lay next to her and put his arm around her and sleep.  He does best when he is touching and being touched.  ,,,,,26,,,,

He still enjoys an inappropriate chew toy like a paper towel or shoe when he can get one but he is doing this less and less. Loose leash walking is still a daily struggle, he understands the concept and is getting better but loses focus constantly given the amazing scents on NYC sidewalks. He has gotten a lot better around other dogs, children and things that move. I am able to control him more and keep him in or near the think and learn zone until the moving person is right upon him. He is much better in class as well though barking is still a struggle. He is great with sit, good with down, heel, get busy and close when I have a food lure.

We have no one below us and only one direct neighbor that is separated from us by a brick wall, though we can hear through it. Our super lives across the hall and she dog sits her sisters shitzhu about once a month for a couple of days. Above us is a 1.5 year old golden retriever. We have two cats, one fat and lazy and one a former stray that is very nervous. Our building and street are quiet but the surrounding neighborhood is busy.     As for lifestyle, I work at the Petco 2 blocks from our house, allowing me to come home during work to take the dog out. I work three different shifts and my schedule changes almost weekly. I work either 7-4pm, 11-8pm or 2-11pm. On a 7-4 shift I get up, feed the cats, get myself ready and then head to work. On an 11-8 shift I typically go grocery shopping and then head to work. On a 2-11 shift I run errands and clean the house, then head to work. I perform most of the domestic duties as my wife works full-time and is in school. With my free time I enjoy running in Central Park or on the East River. There are many parks and fun places for a dog to explore around our neighborhood. On the weekends we typically stay on the UES, taking a walk or seeing a movie. We go out to lunch or dinner somewhere and on Sundays we typically stay around the house as it is the only day we both generally have off together. We also really enjoy traveling. In the next year we will likely head to CA and FL. We would like to have a child at some point next year as well."

While our house is busy when the kids are home, we are not big exercisers or walkers, so we don't need a very active pup.  More docile may be better, but we leave it in your discretion.  I have raised only male animals thus far (two dogs and four cats) so I would prefer to try a female.  But the gender is less important than getting the best suited dog.    We hope to go somewhere warm for a week during a school break (most likely Feb) so we would want a sitter for that time.  We will know, and initiate the request in advance.

After everyone is off to school or work, I usually start working. I make my own hours, so I will be able to take plenty of breaks to spend with puppy whenever I can. Once my children and my husband come home, they are all happy and willing to play with puppy and help with some of the training. We are all very excited to have this puppy in our lives. Weekends we love to get out and go hiking or do things as a family. We live in a neighborhood with sidewalks and we have a backyard where we can go out and play. There are lots of opportunities for different experiences in this area. We have a lot of plans for what kind of places to bring puppy over the next year and a half."

I think that living on a campus with a dog would be a great experience because there are many opportunities for socialization.  I am easily able to get back to my room between classes to take the puppy on bathroom breaks and for some exercise.  I have had experience puppy sitting, so a typical day for me is waking up at about 8:00am to take the puppy outside for about 30-45 minutes to ""get busy"" and some play time.  Then after getting ready for the day, I go to my classes for a few hours, and at lunch time I come back to my room.  During this time, I spent it by eating my lunch and then going for a walk throughout the campus with the puppy.  After a few more classes, I went to work and was able to bring the puppy with me.  Then I took him to the dining hall with me while I got some dinner and practiced some of his skills.  Not every day of the week for me looks like this, but I know that I am able to incorporate a puppy into my schedule nicely.  Especially once my puppy is a little older, I will be able to bring her/him to some of my classes.  However, I do live in a dorm/ condo on breaks so it is preferred that I am matched with a puppy that doesn't love to bark a lot.  Although I realize it is much my responsibility to teach her/him to not do that.  I am very excited for this opportunity!"

We live on a country setting.  There is a town within 3 miles with sidewalks.  We have 2 other dogs, Daisy and Duncan.  Daisy is a 3 year old Lab mix and Duncan is a 3 year old Shepherd mix.  They get along well with other dogs.  We also have 2 cats who live in the house and 5 chickens (who live outside in a fenced in coop).  I am an RN and I am currently working part-time as an Administrative Assistant at my husband's office, as I felt it was time to take a break from nursing.  My work hours are extremely flexible.  Typical day:  My husband and I usually get up at 7am and wake the kids up so they can get ready for school.  My kids leave for school and my husband leaves for work about 8:30 am.  I usually am home in the morning cleaning and playing with my dogs.  Sometimes I go out in the morning for 2 hours doing errands and exercising.  I come back home and get ready for work.  I usually go to work around 1 pm, 3-4 days a week for about 3-4 hours a day.  My 16 year old gets home from school about 4pm.  I get home from work about 5pm.  My husband gets home about 6:30 pm.  We are usually home in the evening.  We spend time playing with our dogs together and go for walks.  We are in good health.  My daughter has friends over 1-2 times during the week.  On the weekends we do not work.  We do a variety of activities, depending on the season and weather.  Everyone in my family enjoys being around dogs.  My life is very flexible."

I participate in softball during the spring for school, and play for a tournament team during the summer.  Any time that I am not in school is considered flexible and after school practices.  However, my sister has agreed to take the puppy out to eliminate, feed the puppy, and have play time.  All the members of my family have agreed to helping to raise the puppy, but I will be the leader.  I am planning on waking up early to take care of the puppy, to go on walks before I get ready.  I understand that some mornings it may be hard, but the puppy's needs will come before mine, even if that means not doing my hair that day.  I have another dog in my house, named Buddy, which I think will be a great role model towards the puppy.  Also, I have two cats, which will give the puppy another opportunity to socialize with other animals.  However with softball and other school commitments, it may be hard for me to be on time getting to Frederick at the 6 o'clock time.  Also, depending if I would have an away game, I may not be able to make it to the 7 o'clock.  But, the season only runs through the beginning of May, so I do not see this being too big of an issue.  Also, with my mom not getting home until 5, and having traffic on the way into Frederick, it is also hard to make the 6 o'clock time.  I will try my best to be on time to all of the meetings and I feel like I would be a good puppy raiser."

I participate in softball during the spring for school, and play for a tournament team during the summer.  Any time that I am not in school is considered flexible and after school practices.  However, my sister has agreed to take the puppy out to eliminate, feed the puppy, and have play time.  All the members of my family have agreed to helping to raise the puppy, but I will be the leader.  I am planning on waking up early to take care of the puppy, to go on walks before I get ready.  I understand that some mornings it may be hard, but the puppy's needs will come before mine, even if that means not doing my hair that day.  I have another dog in my house, named Buddy, which I think will be a great role model towards the puppy.  Also, I have two cats, which will give the puppy another opportunity to socialize with other animals.  However with softball and other school commitments, it may be hard for me to be on time getting to Frederick at the 6 o'clock time.  Also, depending if I would have an away game, I may not be able to make it to the 7 o'clock.  But, the season only runs through the beginning of May, so I do not see this being too big of an issue.  Also, with my mom not getting home until 5, and having traffic on the way into Frederick, it is also hard to make the 6 o'clock time.

I am a stay at home mom to two sweet girls.  Mia Nicole will be 7 yrs old in May and is currently in 1st grade.  She is my laid back, extremely kind, and sensitive child.  Ava Victoria will be 4 yrs old in May and is currently in 3 day preschool.  She is my funny, active, and out going child!  My husband has a full time job with some travel.  He is usually out of the house from 8am till 7pm most days and home weekends.  I will be the primary raiser for the puppy, but my family will help when they are home.  The family as a whole will understand all GEB trainings and concepts, so the pup on program will receive consistent and clear instruction and care.  We are an animal friendly and loving family!  We currently have 2 pugs that are very friendly and get along well with other animals.  Bailey is my fawn female and she will be turning 11 years old in September.  Taylor is my black male and he will be turning 9 in June.  They are very social and enjoy the company of other animals.  One of their favorite doggy friends is a 90 lbs lab mix named Bella.          Our typical day varies with school and activities for the girls.  During the school year, we are up and out of the house by 8:30am.  Our pugs still prefer their crate when we are not home.  Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I drive Mia to school and then drop Ava off at her preschool by 9am.  I am free from 9am to 11:30am or till 12:30am if Ava does lunch bunch.  During that time, I usually go to the gym.  When I have my GEB puppy, I plan to use that time as one-on-one training with the puppy.  In September '14, Ava will start her 4's preschool and will be going 5 days a week.  In August '15, both girls will be in elementary school full time Monday-Friday 8:30am till 3:30pm.  So, I will have even more ""free time"".  Right now, I pick Ava up from preschool at 11:30a and we go home for lunch.  We are home from noon till 3:15p most days, except for Fridays.  On Fridays, we usually get home around 2pm, bc Ava has Little Gym after preschool.  Every day Mia is in school, we leave the house around 3:15p.  If the weather is nice, we walk to school to pick up Mia.  We only live 2 blocks from Mia's school.  On Mondays, we leave around 5pm for Mia's dance class.  We return home around 7pm and my husband is usually home to greet us.  On Tuesdays, we are home all evening.  Right now, the only thing we have on Tuesdays is dropping and picking Mia up from school.  It's usually my day to do most of my laundry and bathroom cleaning.  I vacuum everyday.  I only use natural cleaning products, so no harmful chemicals around the kids or the dogs.  When cleaning my hardwood floors, I only use a steam cleaner...again, no harmful chemicals to harm the kids or dogs.  On Wednesdays, we have the same morning routine, but after picking Mia up at 3:15p, we are home for the rest of the evening and night.  On Thursdays, we drop Mia off at school and are home all day till we pick Mia up after school.  Then we go to Mia's gymnastics class from 4:30p till 6pm, then home for the night.  On Fridays, I drop both girls off at school, pick Ava up around 11:30p, lunch, Little Gym, and home by 2pm.  We pick Mia up from school and home by 4pm.  I am the classroom mom for Mia's 1st grade class and plan to continue that in the future, so I do assist and volunteer at her school from time to time.  Mia is also in girl scouts and I am the cookie mom for her troop.        Our schedule at a glance for the school year:  Mondays:  8:30a-9:00a:  Drop off both girls at school                   11:30a:  pick Ava up from preschool                    12:00p:  Lunch, errands, cleaning (usually at home for lunch)                    3:15p:  Pick Mia up from school (unless she has girl scouts (once a month),                                                      then I would pick her up at 5pm from school).                    5:00p-7:00p:  Mia's dance                    7:00p:  home for the night *girl's bedtime is 8:00pm during the week on school nights  ***except for during soccer season...she has gymnastics from 6:30p to 8:00p.  We are home by 8:30p.  My husband will be home at 7p. However, at the most, I will be gone 3.5 hrs.      Tuesdays:  8:30a:  Leave the house to drop Mia off at school                     9:00a-3:15p:  We are usually home and cleaning.  I will use this day for doctor and                                               dentist appointments as needed.                       3:15p:  Pick up Mia from school and we are home for the rest of the evening/night  ***Except for soccer spring and fall soccer season:  5:30p:  Mia's soccer practice    Wednesdays:  8:30a-9:00a:  Drop off both girls at school                          11:30a:  pick Ava up from preschool                          12:00p:  Lunch, errands, cleaning (usually at home for lunch)                           3:15p:  Pick Mia up from school and we are home for the evening/night                            *we do homework, have some outside play, I make dinner, bath, and bed most                                nights!  Our night time schedule is consistent most nights for school days    Thursdays: 8:30a:  Leave the house to drop Mia off at school                     9:00a-3:15p:  We are usually home and cleaning.  I will use this day for doctor and                                               dentist appointments as needed.                       3:15p:  Pick up Mia from school                     4:30p-6:00p:  Mia's gymnastics (during soccer season, Mia's gymnastics is on                                            Mondays).                         6:30p:  Home for the night and we start dinner and bedtime            ***Except for soccer spring and fall soccer season:  5:30p-6:30p:  Mia's soccer practice    Friday:  8:30a-9:00a:  Drop both girls off at school               11:30a-2p:  Pick up Ava, lunch, Little Gym, and home by 2p               3:15p:  Pick up Mia               4p:  Home for the rest of the night unless we have a social event  ***Soccer season:  5p-6p:  Ava's soccer practice     Saturdays:  Usually my girls do not have set scheduled weekend activities, except for soccer season...  8:30a-9:30a:  Ava's soccer games  1:30p-2:30p:  Mia's soccer games  We usually attend Mass as a family at 5p-6p.    Sundays:  10a-11:15a:  Mia has formation classes at our church, but only during the school year.    Our summer schedule:  Mid-June to Mid-August is more flexible.      Our weekends can be very busy or very laid back.  It all depends on sports, birthday parties, and social events.  When the weather is nice, we are usually outside...either hiking, going to the park, lake, pool, backyard, camping, or some kind of adventure!  I am originally from NC and my husband is from MI.  So, we also travel on the weekends in the summer (usually via car).  We have a large cross over, so it can accommodate kids and dogs.  We have an annual family beach trip every summer (we drive).  Also during the summer (June-August), our schedule is more flexible as the kids are out of school and we will not have a set schedule.  The girl's will have their camps and activities, but they vary and are not as consistent as during the school year.  However, our family does love schedules and we are very organized.           During the spring and fall (April to June and September to beginning of November..usually 12 weeks or so) both girls are in soccer.  Mia has soccer practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays for an hour and games on Saturday usually lasing an hour as well.  Ava has practice on Friday evenings and a game on Saturday as well.  This is a very fun activity for the whole family and when appropriate, I think this will be great exposure, learning experience, and fun for the puppy as well!  We will be at the soccer field Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and twice on Saturday during soccer season.        We live in a 3 story single family home in the suburbs of Washington, DC.  We have a fenced in yard and live in a neighborhood.  Our neighbors are very close and we have many neighbors.  We also have many close friends that live in our neighborhood and most have dogs that we can use for socialization until our pups are fully vaccinated!  Most our friends also have fenced in yards.  We have ample side walks and many trails.  Since we do live in the suburbs, it is important to get more experience for our pup on program.  We have DC that is 30 miles away that will provide new experiences:  city, public transportation, metro, more people, more cars, busier streets, etc.  We also live near Baltimore and Annapolis.  Annapolis has more opportunities as well with the water, boats, bridges, etc.  It will be a fun day out with the whole family!      We participate in numerous charity events through the year.  The girls and I volunteer at the soup kitchen and participate in a special event near Thanksgiving for the homeless shelter every year.  I also run at least 2 half marathon races a year (usually for charity).  These activities usually occur on weekends or during the summer.      We feel blessed to be a part of such an amazing organization and be surrounded by such wonderful people!  We cannot wait to get started!"

After an hour or two, I wake up the kids for school, help with homework, talk while they eat breakfast, and figure out the schedule for the day.  At 8 the kids go to the bus.  I come home and start work.  I typically work from 8-4 and I know I will need to add breaks for the puppy.  The kids get home at 4.  My son usually goes outside to play and my daughter hangs out inside.  My husband comes home around 7. The whole family is typically in bed by 9.  About once a week, I go out to lunch.  Once a month, I travel to Philadelphia for a day of work.  We live in a 3 story townhome.  Our bedrooms are on the third floor."

In our home is myself, my 11 year old son, and I have a significant other that does not live with us but is in the home on a regular basis. We have two consistent baby sitters that we use for when I have to work in the evenings (once a week typically). We have a cat that is approximately 10 years old (not sure, we rescued her from the local shelter). This cat does not seem to be affected by much, including other dogs which have come to visit for long weekends, etc. (I have never seen a cat so un-fazed by anything!) We actually just moved into this home about a month ago, but we are already unpacked and settled in.     Our summer schedule is really very flexible, my son attends camp in town for a couple of hours in the morning or in the afternoon (depends on the week), but is home at least for lunch every day. Starting in August he will have football practice every evening for a couple of hours, which is held at his school about a mil and a half away from our house. My work schedule is very flexible, I work full time for a public school system and my office is only 15 minutes away from our home, and I am able to come home during the day, and could bring the puppy with me once fully potty trained depending on my schedule for the day.    During the school year, my son has school from 8:30 to 2:50, so will be home by 3:00 in the afternoon. My work schedule gets busier, and is usually different every day, but is still flexible to allow me to come home during the day. I have a fair amount of ability to plan my own schedule for most meetings, etc. If needed, my boyfriend can also come over as well as a friend of mine that lives only a mile away and has said she would be willing to assist. I have a per diem job that I work typically one evening a week that does not allow for any flexibility but my son would be home with the puppy with our sitter during that time.    I will be away on vacation/workshop/conference one week in April and I may need a puppy sitter during that week as it is not going to be possible to bring the puppy with me. Typically my parents come down and stay with my son during this week, but they will not be familiar with the training as they live several hours away from us. We usually go away for one or  two long weekends on ski trips during the late winter, so would probably need a sitter during those as well. We were planning a cross-country camping trip for next summer but we are hoping that we could take the puppy with us for that trip.    Weekends right now we do not have any set plans, in September my son will have a football game on one day for a couple of hours. During the winter (January through March) we ski weekends and that will be all day both days. It may be possible for us to bring the dog with us, I am on the ski patrol and have some flexibility during the day, but not always and this will be when we will probably need to have someone come in during the day to take the dog out.     I can't think of anything else, but feel free to ask!!!"

Still working on her body sensitivity.  ,384,Primary,26910,0,17,1DD14,Debra,2014-07-14 12:19:10,"In terms of our schedules, our lives revolve around the academic calendar.  On a typical weekday during the school year, I teach at a middle school and our two teenagers of course go to school as well.  We leave at 7:15 AM and return around 3PM.  Sports, exercise, and perhaps a few errands happen in the afternoon.  My husband is a professor at UConn and has a very flexible schedule.  He teaches two days a week from 11 to 1:30, and then he has a night class from 6 to 9 PM one day a week.  He is home most of the time, reading, researching, writing, but also makes time to walk our seven year old yellow lab, Popcorn, to do some food shopping as needed, and to take the kids to their activities in the afternoon.  He teaches mostly from the West Hartford campus, but he goes out to Storrs periodically for meetings.     On the weekends we shuttle the kids around to friends' houses and activities, do a little shopping, a little cooking, relaxing, some entertaining, and we go to church.  Sometimes our kids have sports tournaments, but usually only one parent attends as they can be quite long (from my perspective!).    Summer plans vary, but usually include a trip.  This August we are headed to Peru from the 11th to 21st, and we are taking a quick roadtrip to D.C.  Popcorn always comes with us on roadtrips; she has traveled to Kansas, North Carolina, Maine, and even to Quebec City where she rode the funicular.  She is an indispensable part of our family and we hate to leave her behind.      We live in West Hartford, in a tranquil, wooded area that is perfect for long walks.  We have a favorite path around a lake that is about 2.5 miles.  Popcorn does this walk almost every morning with my husband, and then I take her out in the afternoon or evening for a different, shorter walk.  The kids often come along. Popcorn has had issues with her knees, so we are careful to keep her weight down and follow her cues for how far she wants to walk.  Most days she walks at least 3 miles.      The rest of us are perfectly healthy!  We are an active family in one sense, yet there is almost always someone home at our house, especially since the kids are old enough to be home by themselves.  We enjoy being home, especially just hanging out and playing with the dog.      In terms of our GEB puppy, we would definitely want a Lab.  The Labs we have owned have all come from reputable breeders of English-style dogs, and we've looked for breeders who focus on temperament in addition to looks.  We've never been interested in showing a dog, but we do appreciate a dog that conforms to breed standards.  I grew up with copies of Labrador Quarterly laying about; it's just in my blood to gravitate towards a stocky Lab with a big head.  So in the looks department we would absolutely adore a British style pup of any color except fox red.  We've always had females, but would be willing to take a male if there is a need.  As far as temperament, we can certainly handle the feistiest of young pups, but I'm not sure our own dog could handle the most energetic pup of the litter.    Thank you so much for this opportunity!  We know that volunteers don't get to pick the pups, but I thought you would want to know the biases that we bring to this project (my husband has jokingly called me a dog Nazi) so that you can make the best match for us and set us up for success.  We will, without a doubt, love whichever dog comes our way."

I babysit my grandsons regularly (ages 7 and 3), and also frequently care for my daughter's dogs while she is at work or school. I play competitive bridge a few afternoons a week but I am only gone for about 3 1/2 hours.  I would be very interested in starting out as a pupper starter or respite provider. Unfortunately we have to be away from Aug. 2 - 11 (family vacation at beach house in Delaware). I am thinking this would be too much for a little pup to handle - the drive is 8-9 hours each way."

She also has some trouble settling at home but has gotten better. (I have trouble settling at home too so that could be why). She needs time to check out new spaces but connects well once she adjusts. I think Cindy described her best when she called her a 'party girl'. She can stay calm and focused for only so long and then has to let loose. She likes to be moving around and checking things out and sometimes settles better when there's things for her to observe.,647,Primary,25739,0,26,6AA13,Almond,2013-04-26 23:25:32,"I usually wake up between 5:30 and 6:00 am. It takes me about an hour to get ready for work and I don't have to leave for work until 7:45. I have about a 10 minute drive and work from 8-5. I go home everyday during my lunch hour, which is from 12-1. During that time I am usually home for about 40 minutes. I then return from work for the evening at about 5:10. I do have dog training classes at Petco Tuesday and/or Thursday nights (depending on whether or not anyone has signed up for the class). The class isn't until 7 so I would have enough time to exercise and interact with the pup after my day job before teaching the class. I am also able to bring the pup to my classes with me, as long as that would be okay with Guiding Eyes. This would depend on the individual class (whether it was a big or small class, and the dogs in it) and it would depend on the comfort level of the pup.  I understand the importance of not putting pressure on the pup to enter situations they are not yet comfortable with and I also understand the need to be able to pay close attention to the pup so I know when they are moving out of the Think and Learn zone. The class is only an hour long so I am usually home by 8:15. I go to bed anywhere between 9:00 and 10:00.   On nights that I do not have to work I like to keep busy and like to be outside. I often go to local parks to take my dog for a walk or I have a couple friends who live downtown whose houses I will park at and they will join me for a walk. My mom sometimes joins me on these walks too, which would give me the option of bringing my dog along with the pup if I wanted. My dog is getting older and tires more easily so I do foresee leaving her home many nights, especially because its important to have lots of one on one time with the pup.   My weekends are very similar to my free week nights. I do hold a 1 hour seminar every other Sunday at Petco, but other than that my schedule is open. I live out in the country and my family owns a lot of property so I like to be outside doing things around the yard, walking the trails, or go for walks in the city and take advantage of the different events going on.    My mom has offered to help out with the pup as much as possible and my brother is also currently available during the day to help out. They both live two houses down from me (there's actually a trail through fields and woods our family owns that connects the two properties). I also plan on taking a week off when I get a pup so that I have time to help the pup adjust and establish a routine. This time will help me get a good idea of if and when the pup will need to be let out or exercised while I am at work."

We had a Wheaten Terrier for 15 years, a Chocolate Lab for 15 years and just had a Springer Spaniel for 4 years who became extremely aggressive and after working with the vet and behavior specialist had to put the dog to sleep.  It was an earth shattering experience, and I am looking forward to learning more about dogs and their temperaments.  I am not ready to own my own dog at the moment and have wanted to participate in this program for a long time.  This is the perfect time in our life to take on this wonderful project.    "

We love gardening, cooking, entertaining, reading, taking walks, and are involved in community events. We have 2 acres of land and lovely paved roads perfect for dog walking. I am a freelance yoga instructor, and occasionally teach photography ( former professional photographer). I enjoy and am fulfilled by the process of teaching and learning.  My schedule is flexible and allows me to be home often without being away for more than 3 hours at a time.  My husband works full-time during the week--we are both home on weekends. We usually take a two week vacation in the fall, and a short getaway in the winter.  We are calm, patient, and consistent.  We have been wanting to become puppy raisers for a couple of years now, and have researched different organizations. Guiding Eyes is the most  concise, supportive organization we have come across. It would be a great priviledge and honor to work with you.  If there is  other specific information we can provide please contact us.  Thank you."

We have a rescue dog named Nora, who is 2 yrs. and 9 months old.  She came to us at 3 months old.  I have taken her for obedience training at Canine Kindergarten, and we are presently taking an advanced obedience class there  Nora has spent time at daycare at Canine Kindergarten and loves to play with other dogs.   Although she is not up to GEB standards, she is a terrific companion, smart, and lots of fun for both my husband an me.    I volunteered to play with the IFT dogs at Yorktown a few years ago.  It was fun, and I was really impressed with the dogs there.    In my former life I was an executive with a privately owned chemical company.  Prior to that I taught economics and finance at SUNY New Paltz.    We live in the woods,  Our house is single story and no fence (we have the invisible fence for Nora).  Our floors are waxed concrete, so they are slippery, but easy to clean.    Our children live close by, and we spend time with those two families.  The kids are used to Nora, so I am sure they and also enjoy a new pup.    I am physically active,  Nora and, hopefully a new pup, would help with that.    Lastly, I love dogs and have had a wonderful life so far.  It is time to ""give back""..and raising a pup for a blind person is something I think I can do well."

Out nights vary.We both have varied social responsibilities. I belong to the Ladies Auxiliary for the East Haven fire department.   John and I both work with a project in Ecuador that helps build schools other things that make life better for our friends down there. We spend time fundraising here and are surrounded by many good people for these functions.   We also are two folks that love the water. We have a boat and enjoy spending time on it and at the marina just hanging out.     I have lived in the area fro my whole life where as John was in the military and travelled for many years. Since I have lived in the area I have many friends and family close by and people have asked me if I should install a revolving door as many people stop in to say hello. There is always coffee or tea on for guests and everyone is alway welcome at 83 Edgar Street!!

We live 4 miles from the center of town but it feels rural.  We do not have a fence but own 2 acres with plenty of space.  The street we live on has only 4 other homes on it so the street is quiet, great for beginning training for a puppy.  We do have an 11 year old female Lab, Tabby, who is gentle and sweet and has helped raise our children so assisting raising a puppy will be much easier! We also adopted  a cat a year and half ago, Charlie, he is 7 years old, orange, very independent and he is declawed.  He is very sure of himself and loves Tabby. We had two cats that were 20 years old and 15 years old that we lost about 1 and 1/2 years ago, we missed having them and so did Tabby.  Tabby and Charlie love to play with each other and enjoy the yard together.  Tabby is our second dog ( Black Lab) and we love dogs!  Our family mostly lives in Maine and we own a family camp about 3 hours north of us on a small lake.  It is lovely and a great place for dogs!

While there is lots of variety, a typical day includes time spent with my dogs including going for walks and ""throwing the ball"" in the yard, working on house projects, and working on cooking or needlework.  I live alone, except for the dogs, and usually have the television on, usually either the news or a CD of movies television programs.  I often can't tell the difference between a weekend and weekday day.    Work.  I'm retired from college admissions but I continue to work about three quarters time during January and part of February reading applications for Bowdoin College.  My work hours are completely flexible and the work is done at home on the computer.  I work best when I take frequent breaks while reading applications.    Volunteer work.  I volunteer at the Orr's Island Library.  I'm on duty for three hours about three to four times a month.  When appropriate the dog can accompany me and can be crated.  The dog is very welcome at the library.  I also attend monthly board meetings and about one other library event each month.    Renovating my old house.  I'm slowly making improvements to my house.  I don't do more than very basic plumbing or electrical work but I have redone floors and installed drywall, cabinets and countertops inside the house and replaced clapboards and painted outside.  While the list of projects is endless, I would say I am more than halfway finished with the major projects.  I fit this work into my life when I can and feel no pressure to finish on a schedule.  Having raised NEADS puppies for three years since retiring, I'm adept at keeping the puppy, and my dogs, safe during construction work (essentially they are never in the area where I'm working and I clean up carefully).  I also enjoy gardening and yard work.    Cooking and crafts.  I love cooking, needlework and other craft projects.  I do routine daily cooking for myself but also regularly enjoy baking and cooking for friends and family so a couple of times a month or more I'm spending the better part of a day or two in the kitchen.    My own dogs.  I have two neutered female labrador retrievers who are still quite lively at 9 and 11 years old.  They spend most of their time in my living room and have dog door access to a fenced in yard.  The fence is in need of some repair.  While it's safe for larger dogs, I don't give my dogs access to the yard when I'm not around.  Needless to say, a Guiding Eyes dog would never be in the yard without me. My dogs usually sleep with me but are comfortable sleeping in the living room.   I co-owned my younger lab with a breeder and she produced four litters including two game warden's search and rescue dogs (including Morgan who has appeared on ""North Woods Law""), one working NEADS dog and at least one therapy dog.  She is now neutered and was a great mother.   My older lab was intended to be a co-owned dog but had to be spayed during a cesarian the first time she was bred.  She is ball-obsessed and a sweetheart.    Time away from home. I don't have the money for much travel and did so much travel while working that I'm fine with mostly staying home.  I visit family in Maryland once a year and spend some time with friends in Maine.      House and neighborhood.  My house is an extended cape with a number of smaller rooms leaving lots of places to put a crate and lots of doorways for dog gates.  Orr's Island is a small community (bigger in the summer) with one local store that will be closing this winter.  In the town of Harpswell there are a number of other small stores.  I believe the only sidewalk is in front of the library but there are many side roads safe for walking.  It takes me 15 minutes to get to Cook's Corner where there is lots of shopping and 20 minutes to get to Brunswick with many opportunities for socialization.  Portland is 45 minutes from my home.  I go there to get my hair cut, to do some specialized shopping and for other activities.  I don't know Portland well but feel comfortable with the city.    NEADS.  I fostered a NEADS dog about 10 years ago while I was still working.  After retiring I returned to NEADS and have fostered four dogs, all of whom were bred by Guiding Eyes.  The first, Marv, will graduate in November.  The second, Ravyn, was dropped after being matched with a school teacher (for alert growling although this was very surprising given my experience with her) and the final two, Matty and Sasha, are doing well so far in their advanced training in prison.  I'm excited to continue working with helping dogs through Guiding Eyes and I'm becoming very aware of how Guiding Eyes dogs and the training of them will be a new experience for me."

We have had our cat since she was a kitten (she is 1 now), and she has never been around dogs. I am a full-time teacher with Mary Cariola Children's Center. On weekdays I am gone approximately 8-10 hours for work. Chris works as part-time EMT (mostly overtnights) and is a volunteer firefighter. He is also a full-time student at FLCC. He currently only has classes on Tuesday and Thursday, and is gone for approximately 8-10 hours on the days he has class. I am an early riser, and am typically awake 2.5-3  hours before I need to leave the house for work. I tend to catch up on work or watch TV/drink coffee during this time. Chris is not a morning person. On days that Chris does not have school, he spends his time doing homework, running errands, doing housework, or hanging out at the fire station. Our evenings consist of making dinner and relaxing. I tend to go to bed relatively early on weekdays, but Chris is usually up later. Most sof Chris' work shifts are in the evenings until midnight, or they don't start until midnight, which means he is awake during strange hours. On the weekends we attend church, spend time with family/friends, and just generally relax. We are a relatively relaxed family. Outside of work/school, we don't tend to be in a rush to do anything. A quick visit to my parents' house can easily become a visit lasting a few hours, it just depends on our moods. Most of our outings are low-key. When we spend time with friends, we are typically hanging out at someone's house or going to a restaurant. We enjoy playing board/card games, reading, and watching TV. In the summer, Chris and I enjoy camping (typically we go for a weekend at a time), going for walks/hikes, fishing, or just spending time outside."

We live in a townhouse on the edge of Oakton/Vienna, with a large open area (park) across the street and a small fenced-in back yard.  Chris (father) works a 7-4pm Monday-Friday job, but has flexible hours.  Mia (mother) works half-days 3 days (Mon-Wed) a week at a preschool, but is off in the summer.  Children are in some week-long day camps this summer off and on.  Hayden will be away at sleep-away camps for 2 separate weeks.  Chloe will be around all summer.  The family has a week-long vacation to Maine planned for this summer, but will otherwise be around.    For the first month or so it is our plan for Chris (father) to work at home Mon-Wed mornings to be with the pup while Mia (mother) is working.  Mia will be at home Mon-Wed afternoons and during the day Thursday and Friday.  We have discussed that this is a family endeavor, so both children will help out.  During weekdays, Hayden will help in the morning (feeding, get busy, and/or walk) before school and Chloe the same in the afternoon immediately after school.  The whole family will help in the evenings and weekends.  The children are not heavily-scheduled with weekend sporting activities but do have some after-school and weekend activities - which we believe will be socialization opportunities for the pup."

We are making good progress here, by allowing her to greet people only when she has four on the floor or is in a sit/down.

Also, I am near the metro parks where I like to take walks and enjoy nature. I think I can provide a save and nurturing home for a Guiding Eyes puppy.    As an independent person, what means the most to me is the idea of being able to train a puppy that will provide someone else the ability  to be independent."

Kids are in school unitl 3pm. My older brother works second shift and gets up about 9-930 and will be home until 2pm. After school I have swim practice until 6 but my younger brother gets home from school about 320. In spring and fall my younger brother runs track and xc, I swim in winter months and otherwise I am home alot. My older sister is away at college and occasionally comes home on weekends and breaks. My dad gets home about 6 and on the days my mom works, she gets home about 830pm. She only works three days a week so will be around to help with puppy on her days off. We are usually up until about 10-1030pm. Swim will be over the middle of March and I will then get home about 3pm each day. On weekends it depends on when my meets are, but they ususally last 2-4 hrs on Saturdays. One or more of my brothers would be here on the weekends. On Sundays we are all usually home. We are usually home alot when not at work or school and like to hike with our dogs in local parks. We live in a rural part of Munson, 6-7 miles south of Chardon, in a neighborhood on a cul de sac-its about 1/2 mile to the end. Our house sits back from the road and is surrounded by trees in the back yard. Our driveway is about 1/4 mile long and our front yard is large and has alot of hills and gardens with trees around the edge. We have two large dogs, an Aussie and a lab/great dane mix and both are pretty mellow. We also have five cats who have always lived with dogs and usually dont bother with them. Our house is a cape with an open kitchen living room area and a dining room and the bedrooms are upstairs and down. We plan to gate off the kitchen/mudroom until the puppy is more comfortable. We have two dog crates, one large wire one and a smaller plastic one that would work for car rides. We dont travel much, usually a week or two in the summer for vacation and occasional day trips locally. We do sometimes go camping in summertime."

[We have not practiced Dania riding in the front passenger seat to date.]  When in a learning zone, she follows all commands.  Dania & her raisers, still need to work on social skills, specifically when meeting & greeting new people at home or out and about.  We also need to work on lead pulling.*  When Dania gets close to new people or when picking up scents, Dania will repeatedly pull, but will eventually settle back into a listening zone. *Dania has adapted to wearing the muzzle while eating meals.  We have not progressed to actually having Dania wear it while walking on a lead.",244,Primary,27371,0,24,1D414,Dania,2015-01-10 22:04:24,"I am currently 69 years young and am a retired well driller and pump installer who occasionally will repair water pumps!  My home is located in a rural and quiet area of Livingston Manor, three miles from town, on a dead end street.  We have one pair of neighbors who live nearby year round, but there home is out of view.  We have three other sets of neighbors who visit their homes several times throughout the year.  My day begins around 5 am when my wife, Kathleen, wakes to get ready for work.  I wake up then too to prepare her breakfast and gourmet lunch!  She's a very lucky woman!  We read the paper - well I do Sudoku and she reads the paper.  We have breakfast together and my wife leaves for work around 7 am. After a 2nd cup of coffee, during the winter months, I head outside to feed the visiting birds.  In the warmer months, I usually head outside to mow the lawn, do yard work, work on our vegetable garden.  I love to be outdoors as often as possible!  After lunch, I often head into town to get groceries, pick up mail, run errands, etc.  This takes about one hour or two.  I'm usually home by 3pm for a cup of coffee or green tea!  Kathleen usually arrives home anywhere from 4 to 5:30 pm, depending on whether she has meetings after work or not.  If the weather is cooperative, we often take a 20-minute walk down our quiet road to catch up on our day!  We have dinner at 6pm each evening - usually in the living room - while watching the news.  After the news, we watch Jeopardy until 7:30!  We then might chat with family members on the phone, watch additional television or catch up on paperwork.  Weekends are spent relaxing or visiting family or special events!  In late spring and throughout the summer, I usually play in a golf league on Monday nights.  Due to ongoing back issues, I don't believe I will continue to play in the league this year.  However, the back issues should not prevent me from becoming a puppy raiser.  This summer, Kathleen & I have two big events occurring.  One, is that we plan to travel to Ireland for two weeks to visit her parents and help her Mom celebrate her 80th birthday!  We also plan to put up a modular home right behind our current home.  The intention is that once the modular is up and ready for us to move in, we will then 'tear down' our former home.  We will continue to live at the same location and address.  So these will be two exciting events happening this year.  Kathleen & I are the only two people living at home.  We both have adult children from previous marriages.  We also have two grandchildren, ages 11 and 6.  Our 11-year-old granddaughter, Madison, lives in Central Valley and we only see her about 4-5 times throughout the year - mostly visiting her in Central Valley.  Madison lives with her Mom, a golden retriever, and 3 house cats.  Our other grandchild, is a boy.  Kaleb is 6-years old and he lives 5 miles away and we usually see him every Sunday.  Kaleb lives with his Mom and two small dogs, Diggy - who is a Jack Russell Terrier, and Maverick - a Chihuahua.  Usually Kaleb and his Mom visit us without their two dogs.  In my lifetime, I have had several pet dogs from the time I was a young boy up until 2 years ago, when Kathleen & I lost our last pet, Keiko to cancer.  Keiko was an American Eskimo dog and we had the good fortune of having him in our lives for 10 years.  My personality is very calm and patient and I love most animals, but I'm partial to dogs.   We both look forward to having another dog in our home and know that he will be in good and loving care when placed with us.  We also look forward to working with Nicole and becoming a part of the Guiding Eyes for the Blind community!"

I am a volunteer Onbudsman for Hands on the Hudson.  My job is to go into adult homes in Sullivan County and ensure the well being of the residents.  I report monthly to Hands on the Hudson who in turn report to Dept. Of Health.  This is a very, very flexible position I go when I choose as I have 24/7 access to the facilities.  So being home all the time is not a problem.  I will do it evenings when my husband is home or weekends.  We live outside of Monticello in the Town of Thompson in a rural community.  (8 houses down the street, if you can call that a community).  We lead a quiet life especially in the winter.  Summer we find places to go to walk, hike usually upstate.   My husband and I have had dogs all of our 32 years together.  From pure bred Huskie to lab/mixes.  Always big dogs 90lbs/plus.  Our most recent 2 dogs died in 2012.  They were our hearts and we were devastated when they died.  Swore we would never have anymore. When  we saw the Sullivan County Democrat article and write up about Guiding Eyes.  We discussed it and I went to your orientation meeting.  Decide that I wanted to be a part of this.  A few friends I have spoken to regard this have all asked the same question ""Will you be able to give the dog back"".  My answer is ""Yes, I am a temporary ""mom"" .Even though I know my heart will hurt the day he/or she leaves  I know that I will feel honored to have been a part of raising a puppy that will go on to do amazing things for a visually impaired person or an autistic child."

He walks well on leash and it is fairly easy to get his attention back when he is distracted.  Although he does drool a fair amount it seems food related, as he does not seem to show any signs of stress in new situations, etc.  We hope he becomes a great guide dog for someone.

He can still occasionally dribble pee when his bladder is full if he gets excited, so I always empty him out right before putting on his vest.

I do not have a full time job.  I enjoy spending my time doing constructive and meaningful things for others.  For the past year, I have volunteered 4 hours per week at Cleveland Clinic South Pointe Hospital as a greeter, wayfinder and wheel chair assistant. I work every Monday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  At the present time, I have no other commitments.  The volunteer work is flexible and I can work 3 hours instead of 4 until the puppy can be left alone for a longer period of time.  Eventually, if it is acceptable to GEB, I would like the puppy to get therapy dog certification and be able to take the dog to the hospital with me when I volunteer.    My typical day begins at around 9 a.m.  I take out and feed my dog and then make my breakfast and read email and current events until about 1:30.  I eat lunch and take my dog for a walk, and exercise in my basement in the afternoon.  I cook and eat supper between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.  I go to the grocery store at least twice a week and usually go out to dinner with friends about once or twice a week.    Because my daughters live out of town, I try to travel to see them once a month, weather permitting. I travel by car to Cincinnati and either drive or fly to Washington, DC.  My daughter in Cincinnati has a husband and 2 children, ages 1 and 3.  Even though I live alone, my GEB puppy will be exposed to my young grandchildren and my 13 year old dog.  My daughter in DC also has a 10 year old dog who used to live with me and my dog before she moved to DC.  My daughter in Cincinnati lives in a semi rural area. And my other daughter lives in Silver Spring, MD and works in downtown DC.  We use the subway system when I am visiting her.    Since I spend much of my time alone, I am looking for other ways to help people and get out of the house.  A GEB puppy will give me reasons to go places and expose the puppy to new things.  I also look forward to being an ambassador for your organization and going to events in the area."

I occasionally work an hour or 2 for a friend who runs a convenience store 2 doors away doing paperwork or working the counter.  I would be able to take the puppy to the store as needed.  Our 15 year old is picked up at 2:05 and the 13 year old gets off the bus at 2:35 pm.  Afternoons consist of being home with the boys.  They play outside or inside, do their homework and generally hang out and relax.  The 15 year old has activities most nights, so I leave to take him around 4:30 most evenings and then pick him up around 7:30 pm.  Generally our 13 year old is home during those times.  Although my husband recently lost his job, he is actively looking for work, so is not typically home during the weekdays.  Weekends are generally spent around home with some soccer games and swim practices mixed in.  We also have an 18 year old daughter who is a freshman in college in Pennsylvania who would be home on typical college breaks."

I wake up at about 6:30-7:00am, to go to school or work, and am home no later than 5pm. I can come home mid-day to walk the pup. I usually run errands or relax at home after school, and go to sleep around 11pm.  I am a nanny to a 4 year-old girl and 2 year-old boy from 7:30am to 4:30pm, usually every Wednesday and occasional Mondays and Fridays. They have a 5 month-old, male Rottweiler puppy that I walk and feed mid-day sometimes. They will allow me to bring the pup for the first few months. I sometimes babysit Saturday afternoons for a family with 2 year-old twin boys and a 4 year-old girl. My work schedule is very flexible. It sounds very complicated, but really is not.  I live in a single-family home on 3/4 of an acre. We have an above ground pool which has a locked ladder when not in use. We live on a quiet street, but have railroad tracks across the street and a firehouse nearby. We live very close to a few parks and walking trails, as well as our emergency vet. We have 4 fixed cats, all up-to-date on vet care and shots. But a pup that doesn't chase would be best.   We don't travel much, and if we do, it is for no longer than a week and never out of the country. I'm extremely excited about raising my first GEB pup and am willing to give 100% to ensure his/her success. I'm a rule-follower (just ask my family- they call me ""by-the-book-cook!""). I can't wait to meet my pup and start our journey together!"

She is pleasant to walk and will lead the way with a steady, quick pace.  She does like to sniff, but if given sniff breaks during walks it can be minimized.  She needs to be watched with people greetings because she will jump if if she gets too excited. She is an extreme chewer, but only chooses dog toys.  She can not be left unattended when chewing because she will go through any and everything.  Scarlett is highly dog distracted and it is hard for her to settle when close to other dogs.",,,,,26,,,,

We have two grown sons.  One in Seattle and the other in Washington D.C.  The son in DC has a 10-12 year old rescue beagle that has been a member of his family for two years.  They occasionally visit or we travel to DC to visit.  No other animals are in our immediate family.  My wife and I have raised two dogs in the course of our 42 year marriage.  A Great Dane before our children arrived and a black lab was with us for 12 years and passed away 10 years ago.  We are extremely partial to labs.  We have nieces and nephews that have had or have labs. Our daughter in law's family has a chocolate lab.  There are no grandchildren.  We have extended family with grand children from teenagers to toddlers however rarely, except for holidays or special occasions are they regular visitors.      As stated in our introductory application, we have considered this relationship for some time.  Given our reduced commitments at this stage in our lives we felt this would be an ideal time to focus on this extraordinary opportunity.  Although, we would like to travel to a warm climate for a few weeks during the winter we have not begun that process in our relatively new retirement lives.  I do not believe we will be away for more than a week at a time in the foreseeable future.       "

I got my first dog Mike, an Irish Setter, when I was 14yrs old, after finding an add in the NYTimes. On Jun.13,1971 I hopped on a train from NYC to Woodmere L.I. with $200 (my life savings) and brought back what was to be a most remarkable dog, one that set the bar for all the dogs that followed.To give an example of one of his talents, he would accompany me on trips to the grocery store and then carry the package rolled up in a brown bag prancing with head held high until we reached our destination (several long city blocks). He accompanied me at college and was allowed to attend a class or two, occasionally carrying my books. CHAPTER 2 (Life style and other pertinent info):  I am an early riser and am usually up by 6:30 . I start my day with a cup of  tea and then walk my dog Luke . He is 14 years old and walks slowly so it takes ~15min to go around the block.I feed him and have my breakfast too and glance at the NYTimes. I am a substitute preschool teacher and get called sporadically.  The preschool is 5 min away from my house and the shifts are for 3-5 hours. My interests include cooking healthy meals ( I have a Masters degree in nutrition), outdoor activities, such as running, hiking, cycling and swimming (indoors in the winter), playing piano, and reading. I live within ~5-10min of both a beach and a wooded area that runs along the Mianus River and has a network of trails which are quite extensive . Both are great places to take a dog!  My schedule is fairly flexible. I spend a fair amount of time doing householdy things  like food shopping, cooking, and cleaning up. On weekends my husband Tyr and I might socialize with family or friends.We travel twice a year to California to visit his family and our eldest daughter, usually for a week.Some summers we might take a short trip to the Vineyard or Block Island.  Tyr is a busy surgeon and often works long hours.  I have 4 children who range in age from 19yrs - 29yrs in age  They are all in school or working. Three of them live nearby (actually one son is living at home but looking for an apt in NYC). Forgot to mention we have a black cat (Beena) who lives with us and get along with dogs who don't chase her.  She loves to follow us on walks with our dog. THE END (it's really late now)."

I have a lot of vacation time throughout the year, but I tend to stay at home.  I don't like to kennel my dogs.  I have raised five dogs for GEB over the past ten years, but took a four year break.  Two are working guides, one is a Heeling Autism dog and the other two were released; one for hip dysplasia and the other for anxiety.  I had permission to take my dogs to school with me.  Students at my school are used to having dogs in the building as we have three therapy dogs there everyday. (one is mine)  Students were also accustomed to having GEB dogs in the building.  They have been taught the rules and understand the end goal of raising a guide dog.    Because I have my own dogs, I try to be home as much as I can on evenings and weekends. I own a home with a 2,000 sq foot fenced in dog run.  I am also an AKC CGC Evaluator and Beginner Obedience instructor for the Finger Lakes SPCA.  I do this during the summer when school is out of session.     In all, I believe my schedule is very flexible.  I have made training dogs a part of my everyday life for the past 10 years."

I do my homework after relaxing for a while and it usually takes around 1-2 hours, sometimes more. In my free time I like to watch movies, go for walks near the beach, go to the gym, or hangout with friends. I shower, eat, and am usually in bed around 11. On the weekends I spend time with friends and enjoy being able to sleep in. On weekdays and weekends I have plenty of spare time that will be devoted to my pup and am looking forward to this experience with much enthusiasm! I do have two other pets, a shy and reserved cat who is 12 years old and an 11 year old westie who is wonderful but at times dominant with other dogs (even big dogs). My only concern is how my current dog with interact with the new pup; I don't want either dog to feel at all threatened. "

She's much better after going to a place once though!  She's slow to respond to commands and isn't the most driven dog- whoever is handling her has to be a cheerleader.  I know some dogs are calmer because their raisers are chill but she's the result of me trying to make her an active, responsive dog and she's still lazy and slow-thinking (but I've come to really love it!).  She's not much of a tester though so when she's slow to respond it's because she's distracted or because she's thinking through everything.  She's very dog distracted (stares or pulls towards dogs, doesn't bark though) and can watch a dog walk down the street for a long time before offering a check in- I've started asking her for them sooner but if she gives me the check in it's a very quick one and she refuses to take treats.   -She seems more distracted by things (people walking, sounds) at night/in the dark and takes a longer time to check in/re-focus....I'm not sure if that's normal and I just didn't notice it with Aurora?  -She had a fear of grated under footings right before going into heat and was still a bit weary of them after heat.  We've worked a lot on it and she's much better, but you can tell it's something that's been worked on and if she's stressed she really has to be encouraged to go over them.   -She randomly stops walking sometimes and just stands there- I think it's usually when we're in places she knows but doesn't feel like going?  Although I'm not completely sure.  I usually just verbally encourage her to keep going and she does -Yahtzee is very low key and her absolute favorite activity is doing nothing with me :P  She loves snuggling on her terms and is so sweeeet about everything.  She's not persistent about things-once you tell her she can't have/do something she just moves on.",,,,,26,,,,

I am currently unemployed so I have time to dedicate to the raising of this puppy. Given that I stay relatively active, the puppy will get to walk or run with me daily depending on my routine. My sister in law lives three doors down and plans to help with the raising of this pup. She's very active and completely on board with the project.  This is something I've always wanted to do and am in a place in my life where I can truly dedicate my resources.  My 21 son will be returning from his travels abroad this November, so the puppy will have 3 housemates to bond with, including me, plus the housemates at my sister in law's home.

Weekends are as calm or busy as necessary with trips to the beach at times. The pup will share the house with my senior (12yo) flat coated retriever, who is a retired hospice therapy dog, who will demonstrate ""settle"" very effectively :) I also have two parrotts who will expose pup to a variety of vocabulary and fun sounds. The queen of the house is my cat, ""Princess Jasmine"", who only cares about the location of her food bowl and her next nap. I look forward to using my experience and resources to raise pups that are well prepared for the important vocation they have been assigned. "

My neighbor also has a fully fenced yard and no other pets. I work from home 2 days/week, and on the weekends I am around the home, doing errands, visiting with friends, taking walks and long hikes, etc. I lead a very active and outdoors lifestyle, and usually meet with friends for some outdoor hikes. In the summer I like to stand up paddle board on the river, and my last dog (a family pet) had his own life jacket and used to love to sit on the paddle board or swim alongside (on a leash) with me. I also go jogging most mornings, and when the pup is older and strong enough I know s/he would love to keep me company for a few miles around the neighborhood each morning.   I have always had a pet dog, and have always raised them from a puppy. Now, my last dog is in heaven and my home has no pets. All my dogs were very well trained, but I am excited about learning the Guiding Eyes training methods. My dogs have always had active, rich, and fun social lives, with lots of outdoor activities. I look forward to sharing that fun with a Guiding Eyes pup."

His house manners have a way to go, but he has only been here for 2 weeks. He has made a lot of progress in that time. He doesn't get as much exercise and I wonder if that's contributing to his mischievous house manners, although he does seem to be a lower energy pup. He doesn't like going outside to play in the yard, probably because he sinks through the 4 feet of snow and he's freezing! On walks, we don't get very far since he has a lot of work to do to get to LLW. Hopefully, more training and better weather will improve his progress.  ",,,,,26,,,,

I also do a lot of quick runs to other offices just to pick up/drop off things that I needed to prepare that client's items.      My schedule for location varies each week, but I tend to working at home in the morning most days and work in client offices 2-3 times a week in the afternoon.  I sometimes usually do a couple of hours of admin work for myself on weekends at some point and occasional schedule a client for Saturday if that fits the client's schedule better.  Generally go out to dinner with friends a couple of times a week.  I have been trying to stay in the habit of walking every morning, but it is harder without a dog to remind you on days the weather isn't as cooperative!  My schedule is generally very flexible, though there are generally a couple of meetings each month that I are have to attend that are set by others and I try to take a weekly yoga class at some point."

She can still become activated with unexpected items that may flit by her, like leaves or debris on a windy day, but I've noted that over time and with practice, she seems much more able to maintain control of her response.   Becka is all about energy. She can be reactive to little yippy dogs that come out of nowhere (a common occurrence here at the beach in the height of summer) and scamper about, especially if they walk too closely. I find I have the best outcome if Becka remains in a sit as the little dog passes by - she's good about the check-in if I'm given enough time to create  a successful situation including distance and the sit.

We worked on potty training, house manners, and kenneling a lot past 6 months.  We even work on leaving food on TV trays and coffee tables. China does not get into trash or chew anything, even when our own dog will carry around someones socks, China does not.  Same with furniture, we allow Georgia to get on furniture and China knows her place on her bed or blanket.  She LOVES to be anywhere I am, but her separation attachment has improved.  But given a choice, she would pick me over other dogs and play.  China does fine in other peoples homes. Things I worked on/still working on with her since day one, moving cars, moving or noise making novelty items.  Things we have mastered: potty outside. not in house or in kennel, and excepting the kennel when I am gone.  Still working on kennel when we are home.  I have worked a lot on simple sits and guided downs when out.  Body blocking has really helped her learn what is not for her.  We need to get back into commands like Go Place, Stay for longer.  But she knows them as well as back, touch, sit, down, stand, come.  Duration!!  Of course, this is me that needs to work on it. Need to start testing her in new locations more often.  We are getting out more now that I know I can trust her not to pee when inside places. Body handling is not where I would like it.  She loves everything touched and messed with but only if she comes to you and in a mellow mood.  Otherwise, she is wiggly at first then settles down.  Working on flash touch while out if she is anxious. There are things she needs work on, mentioned above.  I always look at homework or web wiki to find what to do.

Back to the drawing board to make sure he never gets the opportunity again. It was in a moment of excitability just as I was taking the dogs out to get busy one by one first thing in the morning. But we can usually have food at his eye level and he is not interested in taking it and is great in restaurants and has been good at the other home on a swap. One thing to note- if he can see his reflection in a window (not a mirror) he sometimes barks at it. It will have to be when he is staring for a good while not when he passes by it on a walk. I think this is because he thinks the other dog is staring and perceives it as a challenge even though he is looking at himself. He is great everywhere and a nice companion with good initiative.",,,,,26,,,,

She has made progress in all areas of behavior. The housebreaking remains the most strange. It is surprising that she is still having any accidents. But she is trying and is getting better. The counter-surfing improved quickly after getting negative feedback. She has made a lot of progress on LLW. In less distracting environments, she is quite good and checks in often. She was sniffy at first, so we tried to stick to paved areas (parking lots, wide paths, alleys, etc) and to focus on one route. This helped her learn what I wanted. We have now branched out to sidewalks and to a couple of other routes and she has continued to do well. She also responds really well to changing direction (lots of ""this way""). She does get distracted easily, especially by movement (squirrels, birds, butterflies, blowing leaves but, most of all, other dogs). She responds well both to giving her time to observe and to head turns. She loves to be treated for check-ins! She seems fairly resilient but might be stressed by high traffic and loud noises that she doesn't know where they are coming from. For example, she was okay with a weed whacker across the street (after she watched for a few seconds) but seemed jittery because of a nail gun up above us. To sum up, she responds well to clear communication and going slow. I really enjoy her and think she'll make a nice dog.",,,,,26,,,,

At the Christmas class did a drill which students and dogs made two lines, he did a down stay and of leash recall to me in solid form.  He remained focused and obeyed without deviance.   The efforts of the members of the Fingerlakes group for various classes / training settings are of great value and benefit to the pups. Does very well in various outings.  I have had him in many malls, stores, etc. Recently he was invited into the United Health Services Emergency Room, where we were in amongst the exam rooms.  He did excellent, many distractions, active movement of people, equipment, stretchers, many new noises.  Many people greetings. We have been asked to return as often as we can.  He does very well with greetings of people of all ages, including many very young toddlers. He now barks at times while inside crate in the car, I think its age related,  buts he like to ride in car.  Will now jump into the car and into his kennel without any problem.  Over the holidays had many people in the house and he was very good interacting with them.  He has great spirit energy and is a happy pup.  Follows us around the house and keeps track of where we are or are going in the house.The halti has been of great benefit in compliance and requires less physical effort to control pulling, barking.

I work for a company based in Encino, California and as a consultant, usually travel 1-3 times per month for 2-3 days each time to out-of-state locations to meet with my clients. During these trips, I plan on utilizing approved puppy sitters and my family, who will be co-raising with me.    When I am working from home (majority of the time), my day is almost 100% flexible. My day starts out around 8AM with playtime with my family pet (Annie - 7 year old female yellow lab), followed by breakfast, showering, and reading/devotional time. Afterwards, I usually spend 1-2 hours on the phone throughout the day and anywhere from 2-6 hours doing computer work - again, very flexible. In the evenings I enjoy cooking dinner, going to the gym, spending time with family, watching tv, playing with our family dog, visiting my nephews or cousins, and relaxing.    On the weekends I go to Zumba, church, and may run errands for the week including the grocery store, dry cleaning, etc. I will spend time with my sisters and friends, may travel to a nearby town or city for a day of exploring or bike riding, camp out in a library or unique bookstore to explore, enjoy a barbecue and bonfire with family, go to a concert, or spend the day playing with our pup. My weekend are always flexible and include both relaxation/downtime and lots of socialization.     I am moving (in April) to a 2-bedroom first-floor condo in a tree-filled area near a national park, which I anticipate hiking and exploring in my free time. The puppy will have many nearby opportunities for socialization and though the condo itself is secluded, it is nearby sidewalks, parks, shops, etc. We will also spend time at my parents' home (about 20 minutes from where I will be living), playing out in the huge private yard with our pup Annie. Both my parents have participated in dog training before and plan on participating in Guiding Eyes training as well.    A great match for me would be a puppy who will be (or grow to be) very comfortable around small children (I have two young nephews and many young cousins) and our lab Annie, enjoys activity (hiking, walking) but with a calm temperament. Once approved for travel, my puppy will be able to accompany me on business travel, so a pup with a temperament for travel and being around new faces often would be a good match as well. "

I have lived in Massachusetts my whole life with my mom, Deb Kovacs, my dad, Chris Kovacs, and my younger sister, Amelia Kovacs. I am very excited to be starting this amazing process with Guiding Eyes for the Blind. I am a sophomore at Groton Dunstable Regional High School. Currently, I am competing in outdoor track and field for the high school. Track is my only sport; I have elected not to play fall soccer if I am accepted to be a puppy raiser.     This summer, I will not be working in order to devote as much of my free time as I can to the puppy. I will be free after school in the fall and winter as well. I am hoping to take on the role of the primary raiser for the puppy. I feel that I am responsible enough to care for a dog with the help of my family. I know that this is a great opportunity to help somebody else, and I want to be a large part of that.    My typical weekday during the track season (now through the end of May) is busy but manageable. I wake up around 5:00 a.m. every morning and get dressed, pack my bag, make my lunch, and get all ready for school. The bus picks me up around 6:40 and I arrive at school around 7:00. I finish school at 1:50 and go straight to track practice from 2:30-4:30. I arrive home around 4:45 and go to bed around 11:00. I realize that this schedule will mean I am away from home for most of the day, but it will last only about the next 9-10 weeks. My family is more than happy to help for the month when track and field and the puppy raising will coincide. My mom works part time and is planning to take a couple days off from work in order to spend more time with the puppy. My dad works from home and is happy to let the puppy outside frequently during the day so that it can eliminate.     I realize that for the first twelve weeks, the puppy classes will be held every Saturday. I know that the puppy takes precedence over almost everything, however, because the process is starting a little earlier than I expected, I have three dates that I may not be able to make the entire class. These three track meets are mandatory. The District Relays track meet is on May 2nd and it starts at 1 o’clock. The Division track meet is on May 30th at 1 o’clock. If I perform very well at the Division meet, I will qualify for the All State track meet on June 6th. Besides these track meets and SAT’s the following spring, I have cleared every Saturday for the next year and a half. My Mom will be able to attend all of these classes.    I end school in mid June and start up again in late August. The summer is my most flexible time of the year; I have enough time to spend many hours a day with the puppy. I will also be receiving my driver’s license in July, which will allow me to do the majority of the transportation for the puppy.      In the fall, my weekdays will consist of school. I will be able to come home and care for the puppy around 2:00 every afternoon. In the winter, I will have a very similar schedule to the fall. My family normally has very free weekends. On Saturday nights we sometimes enjoy going to the mall, out to dinner, the movies, etc. During the summer and fall, we love to spend time outside and in Cape Cod. We have one dog already, a ten-year-old black lab. He is well trained and very loyal. We have a cat that is tolerant of him as well as twenty chickens.     In general, I like to take on new experiences. I attended Outward Bound 2 years in a row, which involved intense hiking and paddling, rock climbing, and a mentally challenging 2 day solo experience. I traveled on my own to and from California, finding my way through the airport to the meeting place. I have refereed soccer games for several towns over the past 3 years, learning to deal with kids and adults in high-pressure situations. I feel that I have confidence, patience and leadership skills. I absolutely love animals, and am definitely a “dog person.” The training program of GEB is appealing, and I am ready to learn and apply my new skills with a pup. I already love spending time with my pooch, walking him and playing with him daily. I am determined to make this project work for the new pup, whose success depends on me being consistent and available for its care and training. By teaming up with my mom and coordinating our schedules, I know we can make this a successful experience for a new pup.   "

I can definitely see improvement with her excitement around people. She does well walking past people and ignoring them, but if they come up to pet her suddenly she sometimes loses her self control. Also, if you are talking to someone she might try to sneak in a hello. If they use a squeaky voice we are done for, and I move her away. She still licks a lot!!   Iva still acts very much like a puppy, but you can tell she is trying hard to focus and control herself. We have had some really great greetings where I'm able to get her to sit while someone pet her, but generally when we are out I have not been allowing her to say hi.   She plays great with other dogs, and the cat is her buddy. She is very good about respecting the cat's space and things. She still stalks her toys and sometimes the other dogs.   Iva absolutely loves her crate and will go in voluntarily to nap or chew a toy. She is very good at settling when out and does not need a toy. She is good about getting a toy and occupying herself at home.   She walks great almost all the time and is enjoyable to take for longline walks, as well. Her body handling is coming along well. She doesn't have a problem wearing things. She also really enjoys climbing and exploring different things.   Iva's biggest problem area is her self control around strangers.",,,,,26,,,,

As a teacher I want the children to learn that they have a responsibility as a citizen to give and do for others. They take great pride in helping these dogs  get ready to go to school with an autistic child.The dog visits are always the highlight of the day. The school administration is very accepting of the puppy as a part of the classroom.There is an appropriate space for the pup both indoors and outdoors. This is not something I would consider until the puppy was more aware of and connected to me, but I know it would be a great experience for the children and the puppy. Who knows...the pup may become a stage star. The Heeling Autism Dogs have been part of our class plays for the last 4 years!    So if the puppy is at home while I am at work, there are 2 options My husband is retired and is willing to be there for the puppy during the day. I am home by 4:00 and leave the house at 8:00. My neighbor, Liz Parrone, is taking the puppy raising class with me and is willing to be available as the puppy sitter when needed.    During the school year I live in a house so the puppy will have easy access to the outdoors. We have a great neighborhood with lots of kids on bikes, lawn mower mowing, babies in strollers, etc. I have easy access to sidewalks along quiet and busy streets, There is also access to towns with community activity. We also have a 6.5 year old chocolate lab who pales both intellectually and socially in comparison to GEB dogs. However she is very gentle, loving, playful and good-looking! There is space in the house to separate the dogs when it becomes too distracting or overwhelming for the puppy.     In June I will be retiring! At that point I will be full time with the puppy. We have a home on the eastern end of Long Island. The puppy will spend the majority of the summer out there, We have a fenced in backyard for the puppy as well as all the other benefits listed above from Westchester. I will be home every week for the puppy class. (we have the check on the mother-in-law too!)    My schedule is fairly flexible and I think I have covered the puppy sitting hours when I would not be available. I feel ready to start as soon as possible. I am so excited and really looking forward to being part of your team!"

I will be working part time in May which will be 24 hours a week. Jim does work full time at Praxair and I work for the Visiting Nurses Association.  My schedule can be very flexible because I am able to do my paperwork and phone calls at home. Jim usually leaves the home around 7am and returns around 530pm.  Our daughter Kelley will be returning home on May 29 after a year of teaching in Micronesia.  She will be going to graduate school in Massachusetts the end of August.  Our son Scott lives outside of Denver and gets home several times a year.      We have had a larger dog in the past a boxer who passed away 3 years ago.  We currently have an 11 year old  yorkie named Pierre and a cat. Our yard is fenced in. I am an avid walker and walk Pierre 4x a week.  I always have my dog on leash.  We visit family in the south towns. My family lives in the Bemus Point area and we do travel down there. We also have great neighbors.      We travel to see our son but mostly for long weekends and will be thrilled to have our daughter back on US soil. I enjoy cooking and Jim does the grilling. We are usually home every night. I attend a monthly book club and Bunco group in the neighborhood. We have season tickets to Shea's for a night out. Jim is an avid hiker and rides bikes for numerous charities.  We are both active with no health issues.     We prefer a male puppy and don't have a preference though my brother and Jim's sister have Labs.  I did grow up with German Shepards. We feel that Pierre is easy to get along with and when we visit my brother all the dogs do play together. I do have a large crate that we use for our boxer which is in the basement at this time. I'm looking forward to raising a puppy and i do have to say, I know it will be a lot of work but fun.     On question #18 I did not know if you wanted my vet or the vet that the Erie GEB uses.

There are three humans and 2 dogs in our home.  I, Michelle, work from 8:30-5:00 Monday through Friday (from home). Although my job is busy, I have the ability to intermittently address concerns around the home (i.e. letting the dogs in and out, feeding the dogs, doing some laundry).  Prior to work I try to ""set up"" for the day by preparing dinner, doing laundry, cleaning up the house, and working out.    Joe, my husband is home all day long as well. Because of an illness he has, he tends not to leave the house for extended periods of time. He is generally home for most of the day and is able to tend to the pets and drop off/pick up our daughter from school. He performs ""light duty"" around the home.  Our daughter Katie is 11 years old and in the sixth grade. Her school is very close to our home (within 2 miles). When she is not in school she spends much of her time playing with our 2 Jack Russell Terriers and doing gymnastics.  We live on a quiet cul-de-sac with sidewalks and we have neighbors who pop in from time to time to visit.    Our dogs, Ginger and Daphne are 5 years old. They are sisters and are very loveable and playful.  They love being outdoors and playing in our large fenced yard.  They often get exercised with us as well as we bring them walking or running in the neighborhood or in the field behind our neighbor's house.  Additionally, we have a camp in Speculator, NY where we go frequently in the summer. Many of the people on the private campground where we stay are friends of ours.  Weekends are very low key. We generally stay around the house and run a few errands here and there. We routinely attend church on Sundays which is right next door.  We feel that we will be successful with puppy raising because we love dogs and we have a lifestyle that is conducive to providing a puppy with lots of opportunities to interact and learn throughout each and every day. We look forward to the opportunity to help others in need!"

She needs more experience and work in higher distraction areas.  The kids and teachers at school love her.  She is not in her kennel very often because she is so good outside the crate.  I have not had any house manner issues in a long time.  I have left her inside our home but outside the crate for hours at a time without any problems.  I feel we are working on age appropriate issues - distractions on the ground or other animals or people.  She is not always crisp with her commands so we are working on this.  She absolutely loves the water.  We are at my in-laws for Thanksgiving in Ohio where it is between 40-50 degrees and she loved doing retrieves in their pond.  When we are out, everyone is always commenting on how well behaved, calm and easy going she is.  She was very patient and did a long down-stay when I was trying on clothes and shoes in the busy mall!",,,,,26,,,,

I don't usually go on vacations and tend to stay home on weekends through out the year unless I have to do something for a class or work. At home I have a 7 year old low energy chihuahua. The first two years we had her we also had a German Shepherd who sadly passed away. She does alright with other animals, but is really unsure of them especially if they are high energy. My family and i have soft spots for big dogs, especially German Shepherds. "

We also have a cat who has been around our dogs since she came to us as a kitten and even with claws, she NEVER swats the dogs.    Our daily routine:  Dave wakes between 5 and 6 a.m.  lets the dogs out, feeds them, lets them out again.  I usually wake at 5:45 am, go to the pool and swim, come home, dress and leave for work.  Dave will then take the 3 dogs and walk 4 miles. (We started walking 3 dogs when we had Belmont).  He is home with them most of the day except when he does errands; he grooms the shepherds a couple times a week and I groom the Yorkie once a month (bath and clipping).  He does a second walk later in the day depending on the temperature outside.  I come home from work and we are on the porch or relaxing inside and then eat dinner.  Before bed, the dogs go out again.  When we get the pup, I will adjust my routine to include a morning walk and an evening walk as well as ""play"" since Dave will not be able to walk 4 dogs.  I will also ensure the progressive socialization of the pup (had to do this with Tex); started with short walks in the cul de sac, then the next neighborhood, then the little shopping plaza up the street, etc.      Dave works for NVCC; he is an Associate Dean and Teacher; most of his work is virtual.  When regular semesters are in session, he goes into the campus for about 4 hours 2 - 3 times a week.  I live about 8 min. from my job and have flexibility with telework.  When we raised Belmont she went to work with me on the Metro a couple times a week (downtown D.C.).    I swim because of my lumbar discs; can't run anymore.  On the weekends I take the shepherds and play ball (which they love) to let them stretch their legs.  On Saturdays we often take the younger shepherd, Tex,  and the Yorkie (Huey) to Reston Town Center where James Oliver (DogU) has group socialization for many of his clients and their dogs.  We have been taking Tex out since he was a pup (almost 2 years now).    This has been a fabulous experience for the noise, kids, and crowd socialization.     We have 2 local grandkids (10 and 8) who have dogs and have been around our Belmont for the past 5 years.  They will spend the night a couple times a quarter.    Our schedules are very flexible and we both plan to take the Pup to work on various days after the little one earns his/her vest.    Weekends I take advantage of the time off to take the shepherds on a long walk on the bike path; they are champs and can handle the bikers, runners, and other dogs as well as strollers.    My personal work travel is minimal and very manageable; Dave does not travel.  Our personal travel; we will be going to Europe in Oct. for bike trip:)    I currently am an Adoption Coordinator for Lab Rescue and have been reducing my applicant pool so I am ""freed"" up when we get a pup.  My time will be dedicated to the pup.   It has been just 2 years since Tex joined our pack at age 3 months, so we are puppy refreshed:)    I hope this helps!  WOOF, Mary  "

This allows me to come home for lunch daily.  The other is  part-time evenings and weekends consisting of approximately 15 hours.  The evening shift is 5-8 and the weekends are 8am-2pm.  Once again I am within 5-10 minutes from home.  They are very understanding and interested in my commitment to raising a GEB puppy and have already altered my schedule so I can attend puppy classes on Monday evenings.  I am very much a homebody and enjoy gardening, bike riding and walking, hiking in the summer and reading, cooking and baking in the winter, hence the 20lb gain from our past fabulous WNY winter.   My 20 year old daughter is home from school for the summer and works at our complex as a lifeguard.  She is attending a local college and is studying Animal Behavior and Ecology Conservation.  She is very excited about this opportunity to raise a puppy for a visually impaired person, a child or some other alternative career.  We have never had a puppy or dog as this is something I did not want to even attempt without having the proper training to be a successful and responsible dog guardian.  I thought this would be a fabulous experience for both of us and give us a taste of being responsible puppy/dog lovers and owners for the benefit of someone in need.  We are animal lovers but have always been cat people and let's be honest, it doesn't take much to be a good cat caretaker.  We currently have two house cats that do not go outside.  They are both spayed females.  Pixie is a year and a half and Belle is going to turn 4 on July 7th.  They have a love hate relationship and both sleep on purr pads on my bed (this is the love part) or in their cat tree.  They also love to watch the birds in our feeder from the sliding glass door in the living room.  We live in a two-story townhouse in a beautiful parklike setting.  We have lots of green space and plenty of opportunities for socialization.  We also live very close to a village for walking experiences.  My daughter and I walk on a regular basis and are both in perfect health.  We are hoping for a sweet female to complete our girl pad!  We can't wait to meet our new family member and are hopeful it will be soon after our ""graduation"" as I am off from my full time job for the summer!  Thank you for your time and we are looking forward to working to be the best puppy raisers ever!    Lisa and Emma Miller"

I stay home with two daughters, Ava (15 yrs) and Ashley (11 yrs).  My husband is home a little more than 1/2 the month and travels the rest of it.  The girls are self-sufficient and help with chores.  I get up and make them breakfast/lunch for school, and they are off by 7:30-2:50 school days.  Once they leave I usually eat breakfast, check e-mail, pay bills, paperwork, gardening, pick up the house, grocery shop, exercise (walk, bike, weights at home or yoga), or work.  I own a small business (TootSweetSoapShack.com) making handcrafted goat's milk soap and cream, and sugar scrubs.  Making products usually takes about 90 min - 2 hours at a time start to finish, then wrap the products at a separate time.  I deliver my products locally to 3 small stores as needed, and wrap up local orders to leave on my porch.  I try to start dinner before the kids get home, we usually eat dinner after school before activities start.  Most of my older daughter's activities (Pole Vault Club, Aerial Silks, Dance Classes, Village Project Volunteer, Key Club Member, Horse Riding Sessions) are at the high school or in town.   My younger daughter Ashley is involved with Oberlin Choristers (Monday night practice and occasional recitals), Vocals at School of Rock in Rocky River (45 min lesson once a week and 1.5 hour band practice), guitar lesson at our house on Sundays, and occasional Art classes.  We participate in carpools, but should not be away from the house for more than 2 hours, and plan to bring the puppy with us whenever possible.  Both vehicles can accommodate a crate without a problem.  We will have house guests as our family lives in other parts of the country but visit frequently.   Our summer is pretty laid back with some traveling. My husband is a pilot for United Airlines, and plans to contact the chief pilot to find out about airplane travel with the puppy as we would like to bring it with us when it's old enough.  We were planning on going to Seattle to visit family for Christmas, but if the puppy isn't old enough to join us we will postpone until it is.  Next summer (July) we have an extended family reunion/heritage trip to Sweden and Prague with my husband's family for 10-12 days.  The primary caregiver will be me, with the help of my daughters when they are home. I have one concern that I discussed with Theresa Camloh and she thought it would be worked out:   1.  We have 3 rescue cats that I believe will be ok when we  bring a new puppy into the home after a transition period (one will be aloof, one will be best buds, and one may stay upstairs for the 18 months because she is afraid of her own shadow but desperately wants to be pet), but it may be difficult to bring a new puppy into our home quarterly because of the transition period of them accepting a new family member.     We are very excited to be part of the Guiding Eyes Program :)"

I plan on bringing her kennel because of her excitability issues.,<map object at 0x7f0e89bfe400>,3,3,0,"Overall, Emily is fun to be around and she is a really smart dog and a quick learner. The biggest issue is her inability to calm herself down when she gets excited or frustrated. She gets herself into a frenzy and you can tell she has no control. I've tried increasing the distance and distracting her, but all that seems to do is make it worse.  I've tried standing still and also trying to get her to walk in a different direction which doesn't seem to work either.  She becomes a growling, biting, run around out of control mess. I have to pick her up and put her in her kennel. This is fine if we are in the house, but when we are outside and I have to carry her 2 or 3 blocks to get home it becomes a problem.  She seems to come unhinged and she becomes what we call ""hair on fire crazy"".  We aren't quite sure what sets her off either. One time she became unhinged because she wanted to eat an acorn and I wouldn't let her. So, I had to pick her up and carry her the three blocks home because she wasn't listening. Every time I put her down I could tell she still wasn't in control of herself. Another time, the situation was pretty exciting - she saw a rushing creek for the first time so it was fast movement, loud noise, and water!  She wasn't sure about it at first so she kept running up to it and then running away. Each time she would get closer and not run away as far. She finally figured out it was water and she was thrilled to death and at the same time became unhinged. I ended up having to carry her the quarter of a mile home because, again, each time I put her on the ground she exhibited the same out of control behavior.  She bolts in every direction, growls, and bites at my clothes. Evidently three blocks away from an acorn or a quarter of a mile away from a creek is not enough distance to allow her to calm herself.   Loud noises and different surfaces underfoot do not seem to be a problem at this time. She walks on concrete, grass, gravel, tar and chipped roads, dirt roads, paving blocks, and paved surfaces without a problem.  The only noise I remember startling her was the fire trucks briefly testing their siren and horn one morning. We were about three blocks away from the fire station when, for about a second, they turned on the siren and honked their horn. Emily was startled by that and stood there for a second or two and then she was fine.  We continued on our walk as if nothing had happened. This was the first time she had ever heard that noise.   The diarrhea has been a huge issue and I think it has also somewhat impacted her training a little since I was afraid to give her too many treats and when we are rushing to get her outside so she doesn't have an accident in the house, the last thing I am thinking about is proper manners and walking appropriately on lead. I'm hoping that once we get her GI issues straightened out we can get better at the training.   I do think her behavior, when she is in class, has improved over the past few weeks. She doesn't seem to be as restless as she was in the beginning and she seems relatively calmer around the other dogs as long as they keep their distance. She still needs to improve a lot, but I think I see a difference in her as the weeks go by.  Tiny improvements each time we attend class. Grant it, to an outsider she probably still looks like a wild woman, but to me, I can tell she is a bit better than she was about paying attention to me and while she still gets distracted, she seems to be able to recover herself a little bit quicker each time.",106,Primary,27962,0,3,3EE15,Emily,2015-07-01 13:59:33,"My household is made up of just my husband and me.  We currently do not have any other pets.  During the week, we live in a small townhouse, but on the weekends we live in a slightly larger log home on 15 acres.  Neither home has a fence so we are used to constantly having the dogs we have owned in the past on leash.      The townhouse is three levels and the floor surfaces are vinyl tile, concrete, and carpet.  We have stairs that go down into the basement and up to the second floor.  Our townhouse backs up to a small shopping area that has a grocery store, two eating establishments, and other small retail establishments.  There is always some type of activity going on in the neighborhood either the yard crews are cutting the grass (noisy lawnmowers, leaf blowers), kids are playing in front of our house, the mailman is delivering the mail, etc.  We also live about 5 blocks from an elementary school and community pool - all of this is in our subdivision.  There are sidewalks and bike paths to walk the puppy along. We walk to the grocery store 2-3 times a week to go grocery shopping.  We have a fire department 3 blocks from our house that has fire trucks and an ambulance. We also live close to Frederick City and can go into the city in the evenings for social outings.  The city has a lot more cars and distractions then at either of our other two houses.      Out at the cabin, the puppy will get to experience, rocky roads, dirt paths, grassy paths, various wildlife (turkey, deer, bear, snakes, bobcat, grouse etc.), mud, and lots of water.  The log house is 2 hours from our townhouse so the puppy will get used to ""riding"" with us.  The floor surfaces inside the home are ceramic tile, carpet, and hardwood flooring.  We have sliding glass doors and the inevitable screen doors that all of our dogs have had to learn about.    I have family that live on the Eastern shore so the puppy will be exposed to the bay and ocean, Annapolis, sea gulls, sand, etc.      During the week, my husband works from home 5 days a week and I work at home 2 days a week.  My husband travels about 2-3 times a year for about a week at a time.  I travel anywhere from 0-6 times a year from 1-2 weeks each time.  The puppy will not be going on work travel since we will be in areas that do not allow animals.  My husband and I coordinate travel so one person will be home while the other person is traveling.  Once the puppy is housebroken and has a little more self-control he will be going to my office with me.  My office is an hour away from my house and I leave at 5 AM.  Work consists of sitting around reading at my desk, going to meetings, going to the Farmer's Market on Tuesdays, riding in elevators, walking up stairs, going through sliding glass doors, going to the cafeteria for lunch, going through security check points, walking on carpet, tile, marble, and concrete.  I work on a Federal Government Campus so we are fairly isolated and there is a lot of open space and trees where I work.  Inside the buildings, there is a lot of glass and open spaces.  My job may be changing soon which will mean less work traveling and more time actually going into the office instead of working from home.  It will just mean that the puppy makes the trek into my office more times per week then he would be doing now.      Any personal travel that my husband and I have done in the past we have always brought our dogs so vacation time is making sure the dogs can go along too.  The puppy will be used to hotels and long rides.    That's about it.  Our life is pretty ordinary, but we do have a lot of different things going on."

We have tried to give Maury a variety of socialization experiences and believe that he has gained some confidence. He seems to be a ""happier"" pup than he was (he has gained skills in playing appropriately with other pups, and loves to do so). He still however, sometimes shows signs of stress/lack of confidence when exposed to new or particularly challenging environments (drooling, yawning, and ""flopping"" onto the floor). Stairs, in particular, have been a challenge for Maury, but inconsistently so. We are unclear as to whether this is due to a lack of confidence or coordination or both. We have seen improvement in loose leash walking and connecting with his handler. We are enjoying our time with Maury very much.",,,,,26,,,,

She is pretty bold and confident with the exception of stairs. She responds better to body language than verbal cues and definitely needs to continue to work on her listening skills.

We have many family members that live with in a one mile radius and if needed could make a trip and allow the puppy to ""get busy"". Included in this is four retired parents. We leave for work by 7:30 on weekdays. Kathy works a mile from home and can take lunch at home. Kathy also can be home by 3:15 to drop Alli off from school to attend to the puppy. Our daughter Alli is soon to be 16 and is going to be an integral part of the puppy raising. Zach, our oldest leaves for college in the fall and is looking forward to helping when he is home. I work for Verizon and often pass through town and can stop for a quick check and bathroom time. There is always someone home from 3:30 in the afternoon till morning. Our weekends are extremely flexible with occasional trips to parade and fire dept functions. This will be an excellent opportunity for socialization when the puppy is ready. Kathy is a teacher and class adviser which will allow the pup to attend many different social environments through school. Wes is a county fire coordinator and would be able to take the pup to meetings and expose the pup to another experience. Our extended family also has many animals to expose the pup to. (cows,goats,rabbits,cat,chickens,horses) We have had three previous dogs as pets. A golden retriever,beagle and a dalmatian. The dalmatian was trained and proficient enough to march in the parades with Wes off leash and was a real crowd favorite. We have had a relationship with our Vet for over twenty years and find them very caring and willing to make emergency calls if necessary. We look forward to learning and being able to help teach a puppy to become someones guiding eyes.Thank you for your time."

Gladys is friendly toward my other cat and learning to respect her space. Same with my personal dog. Gladys has improved when approaching stangers, and when she does get excited is more easily redirected.

No children. Our home sits in the middle of three acres outside of a housing track but on a somewhat busy road.  Plenty of side walks along the road and into the neighbor hoods/housing tracks, around us that work into an elementary school.  Most times the area is very quiet but the occasion loud picnic occurs.  Being in Henrietta has it good and bad.  Bad, it's a grid town and not a village to walk to different places.  Good, there are still plenty of businesses, plazas & mall, Town Hall, library, and grocery stores to sit and watch activities and still short distance drives.    We have raised 8 puppies for Guiding Eyes, last two being Halsa (7HH10) and her mom Shelby.  Puppy number 5, Verna, was a medical release who we adopted and is still with us today at the age  of 12.     We both work Monday - Friday.  Donna works 8:30am - 4:30pm; Steve varies from 4:30am - 2:00pm.  Donna works in an office at the University of Rochester where Halsa spent many days a week like her mom Shelby.  Steve is a route driver for a coffee company so no opportunity to have the puppy with him at work.  Our weekends are generally open to doing things around the house to family/friend events that may come up.  Sunday morning is church which will be an opportunity to socialize.    Both of us enjoy running races, 5K's, 10k's, 1/2 and full marathons during the year, more Steve than Donna.  Depending on locations and size of race, these have been good outings based on the puppy's age.  Lots to see but plenty of space to back away when needed.      We are looking forward to raising another puppy and hopefully one of Halsa's puppies to say we raised a mom, daughter and grand daughter.    Cheers -  Donna & Steve Derks"

We live with my husband Paul and daughter Mary who will be going off to college in the fall. The four of us live in the suburbs in a ranch style home on 3/4 acre land. The back yard has some fencing but is not completely closed off. My husband and I have always had dogs, but when our son Pete was born we discovered he had asthma. This is why we did not adopt again when our dogs passed away. Pete has since outgrown his asthma and we are more than ready to begin raising a dog again. I am a physical therapist and presently work on a per diem basis. I am also taking online classes to earn my Masters in Orientation and Mobility, therefore I am often home studying.  Pete finishes school June 19th and will be a freshman in the fall. He plays baseball 3-4 times per week throughout the summer, but otherwise is usually home. After June 19th, someone will always be home.  I am taking 2 online classes this summer therefore we are unable to go on a long vacation, however we hope to take a day/overnight trips occasionally. Because we have not had a dog in years, we would love a mild mannered puppy (if possible) to begin our puppy raising experience. Sex does not matter unless you think one or the other is easier for a beginner. We truly cant wait to begin!"

I call him back and he does come and sit.",96,Primary,27986,0,22,5OO15,Opie,2015-07-24 13:44:41,"Overall, I have a flexible schedule. My work week is Monday thru Friday, however I work for myself and make my own hours. The work environment is very calm in that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist and Yoga Therapist. The office is about 15 min from my house and is located on the second floor of a very old factory building, think Erector Sets the toy from years and years ago! It has wooden floors and big windows that are up higher, a very forgiving environment with lots of stairs and hallways. I can easily have a kennel there and my clients are looking forward to meeting our new friend. I plan to have enough time inbetween appointments to give the pup my complete attention, which is just a matter of how I choose to book the appointments. I can also have the pup at home and break up the day from morning and afternoon by being home for several hours. Most probably a bit of both. Two Wednesdays a month I am away from home from 8:45 until 5:00 (including travel time) working in a corporate setting. On these 2 days my daughter (Alison 31) has agreed to spend time with our little girl or guy. Joan Moore, also a puppy raiser, has also agreed to me dropping the pup off at her house for some pup playtime. I don't work on weekends. The home life looks like this: 2 female sister cats who are 2.5 years old and do not go outside. They have never scratched or bitten me or anyone else, and are very timid although curious and friendly. They are up to date on their shots and I use Revolution on them even though they are inside, just to be safe. My partner is John Terry who is an absolute lover of all animals and most importantly very well trained by me! (Hehehe) Meaning, he understands that I am the main trainer for the pup and he is willing to be on the same page with me in all the activities concerning the pup. We live in a small cape home (1,200 sq feet) which is already animal safe because of our cats. We do not have sidewalks, and the road we live on is relatively busy, however, there are side roads which are not. I am also willing to drive to where there are sidewalks to get a diversified experience. I believe that we are relatively well setup for this experience. I can only say relatively because it hasn't happened yet! But wherever we may be lacking we are willing to do what we need to do to improve the accommodations. I am a bit nervous! It's a tremendous responsibility, however, I also know that I communicate better with all animals than people, so I feel confident to learn the language. I have had 2 dogs before in my life, they were my best friends and will always be a part of who I am. In retrospect, I am surprised they were as well behaved as they were considering I knew nothing! An additional thought I would like to add is my request for a black dog. I live in black leggings for my work and the maintenance of the removal of yellow hair would be something that I really would rather not have to devote time to. I do hope that doesn't sound offensive in any way, but if I know me, this pup is going to very close to me most of the time and I plan on being hairy. I also believe, but perhaps not accurately, that the female black labs tend to be a little smaller, which given the ways in which I depend on the well being of my fingers, hands and arms, might make more sense for me. All THAT being said, I soooo do not wish to create criteria that puts me right out of the program, so it's just my humble opinion. Oh, and I bend, crawl, jump, bark and roll over. Wait, I won't bark.  I hope I have created a picture that is clear, and user friendly for all of us. Thank you for this wonderful opportunity, I have already learned so very much and it's hardly begun. Peace"

I live in a single family house in Oxford, CT.  The only other one in my household is my son, who is 29, and lives downstairs.  He understands that in order to be fair to the puppy and not confuse him/her,  he needs to follow the Guiding Eyes rules.( He loves dogs and will spoil them if allowed)  :)     We have two other dogs in the house - my son's dog - Dixie - a 10 yr. old blue tick coon hound spayed female and a 1 1/2 yr old Chihuahua/Papillion (?) mix - Peanut - also a spayed female.  Peanut is just graduating from a pet therapy program and I will be doing some hospital and nursing home visits with her.  I also have two horses on my property.   My backyard is fenced in with stockade fencing so the dogs can't get out but I am use to watching them while they are out playing.      My schedule is very flexible.  I like to walk and keep active.  I have had many dogs over my lifetime.  I use to foster dogs, take them to obedience classes and then find them very suitable homes.  I have done a lot of dog sports over the years - agility, fly ball, frisbee, sheep herding and showing dogs in both breed and obedience.      I am open to any puppy.  I have had mostly females in the past but I have had 2 males.  I don't know of any intact females or males in my neighborhood but you don't always know that until you have a dog come into heat :)     I am very excited to raise a puppy for the Guiding Eyes.  "

I may be able to take the dog to work with me and have her stay in the teachers lounge while I am out skiing. I typically teach for an hour or two and then have an hour break and then teach for another hour or two and so on so that I can spend time in between lessons walking her around the resort, and getting her used to lots of people. I will have to work that out with my employer. That part time job lasts typically until the end of February. When I will be home full time again. I am a runner, hiker and backwoods skier, and plan to have the dog accompany me as soon as she is old enough.

Because of my work and volunteer work, Clive attends alot of public functions and travels with me 1-2 hours in the car most days.  He is generally good at playdates but can pick out a pup/dog that he wants to 'hump'. He is improving with the cats.  Once moment he is laying next to them and the next moment he could be barking at them.  When he barks, I will separate/barracade him from cats and he gets the message.  Clive has strong foundation skills, is a pleasure to walk on leash, although when he's ""had enough"" he will start to chew on the leash.  I will then stop, unclip his leash and with his collar, do a guided down and wait for him to settle.  This usually works.  He is a very loving pup who wants to be with me at all times.  He loves to go for rides in the car and to go to work.  One of his favorite things to do is go to the mall.  He likes to run in the yard but not much of a fetcher.

Jess is very in tune to her people and loves to get praise and attention, sometimes that is more motivating to her than food.

This gives me more flexibility to do walks or socialization in the AM or PM depending on weather and how much light is in the sky. We don't have children so the pup will be the main target of our love and direction and we will be able to bring him/ her to socialize in a variety of situations and will be able to focus on the pup to integrate training throughout the day.

I often take walks around the 1 mile loop around the neighborhood with other dog owners. We do not have sidewalks. Our house is very busy. We have people, friends and family both adults and kids coming and going regularly. We have a fenced in yard and a pet standard poodle, named Sanibel. We enjoy dogs and helping people.

I have been using a prong collar on him some of the time (especially when I know we are going to an area with high distraction), and he is excellent when it is on.  With just the martingale, he is harder to control, and doesn't listen as readily.  HIs confidence is great, and his temperament is phenomenal.  I think it is mostly age related.  I'm trying to up his exercise, and have begun biking short distances with him, which he loves and is very well behaved when doing.  His biggest issue is that he gets overly excited when playing with other dogs, and starts neck biting and barking.  I am interrupting play frequently, and not letting the energy level get up there, but it is challenging.

She has always kept her crate clean.  3) Gladys responds well to clear expectations - will work for food, toys, play, life rewards. While she has shown a quick and sometimes marked startle response, she is extremely resilient - has never ""shut down,"" and has always been willing to ""go check it out."" And repeatedly approach from different directions, etc. When she 1st came to me, my assessment was that she had high visual, auditory, and olefactory distraction - probably contributing to the difficulty Lucille had in getting her house-trained. She does well with slow and careful exposures, and I have found short outings and watching her body language carefully is important - she will start to pant, occasionally yawn, sniff more, move more quickly and lose focus and connection if she is unsure of herself. Some of her social outings have included 3 different post offices, CVS drugsore in quiet times, a church service concert and coffee hour (many people greetings) afterwards, library, 1/4 mile track in Yorktown, settling at staff meetings and committee meetings, quiet residential neighborhoods in White Plains, bigger street in White Plains on Sunday morning - minimal traffic, Yorktown, Shrub Oak, Mt. Kisco, Katonah, Briarcliff Manor, Brewster, New Paltz, shopping center parking lots and walking in front of store fronts, automatic doors. I think she needs time to take new things in with ALL of her senses, and I tried to keep outings limited to 20 minutes or less so that she would get new exposures without feeling overwhelmed. I think she is still a fairly immature 9 month old, but has made great progress. She does very well with support - how she will do when she doesn't have that support, I don't know, because she still seems pretty young to me. She is a very sweet, very pleasant pup, loves to run and play, but has also done very well ""hanging out "" when I am at work and did fine with almost no exercise for several days in a row. She continues to improve re dog distraction, and will offer auto checkins some of the time if the dog-dog distance is appropriate. High value treats get her interest readily. There is probably more I could write but I am sure I have gone on long enough, other than to add that she needs a very patient raiser.",,,,,26,,,,

In mid-march I will have the choice to return to work on a part time basis--fewer than 20 hours a week on a schedule that will place the pup's needs first.

We are both in good health, enjoy the outdoors and are active and happy people.  I anticipate a typical day with a new pup will likely  start out when we normally get up in the morning---about 6:30 and proceed something like this:  6:30-Get Busy  6:40-Feed Pup  (I put on clothes) & Get Busy  6:50-Feed me  7:10 Get Busy  7:15-7:45 Reward with play  7:50-8:10 Start morning chores (breakfast dishes, make bed, etc) together.  8:10 Get Busy  8:15-8:45 Finish morning chores  8:45 Get Busy  (Are we Getting Busy too frequently?)  8:50-9:10 Work on specific behavior--eg class work.  9:10 Get Busy   9:15-9:30 Reward with play.  9:30-11:00  Kennel up with toys for nap.  I go to gym.  11:00-Get busy. Feed Pup. Get Busy.  The remainder of the day is generally open and my schedule is flexible.  If a return to work the pup will never need to stay in the crate for more hours than he can do comfortably  based on his age.   We have 2 children.  The oldest is 23 and lives and works in Baltimore.  The youngest is 20 and is a Junior in college.  He will be home for vacations and for the summer.  He is enthusiastic and supportive of this opportunity.  He loves animals, especially dogs, and is fully aware that there are critical skills and socialization ""rules"" for us to follow.  I look forward to your input regarding how I can best adjust my schedule to make the most of puppy training for the pup and for me!    What?  No question about Zu Zu's petals?"

I work in marketing for IBM and generally work remotely.    Our day begins around 8pm when Kieran gets up.  Lakshmi is normally gone to work at the hospital by this time so I get Kieran ready for the day (changing him, using the bathroom, getting dressed, and preparing breakfast).  Kieran knows a puppy is coming to live with us in January and is very excited to help with the training.  Kieran is very active and talkative and will need to be trained on how to approach the puppy (as well as vice-versa!)  Kieran’s nanny comes at 9am and stays until 7pm, at which point Lakshmi is home from work.    During the week, I tend to work from a few different places.  I often start working at home and sometimes work from home all day!  Other days I go to an office in midtown near Bryant Park.  I am now driving to Westchester once a week to work in an office there but I expect that to be over by February or March at the latest.  The puppy is welcome at all these work places regardless.    During the day I normally go to the gym or for a run for an hour and the puppy would be left at home in the crate, until the pup is old enough to join me for sustained outdoor exercise.    In the evenings I tend to be out and about doing a variety of different things – playing on a sports team, meeting a friend for a coffee or drink or dinner, going to lectures or meetups on topics I’m interested in, and other social activities.  I’m planning on integrating the puppy as much as possible into these activities.  I also hope that since I will be spending the day with the puppy that the pup will enjoy taking naps in the crate in the early evenings.  Overall though, I understand the pup is my first priority and I don’t have any activities that simply can’t be skipped.    I will also take the dog to visit my parents in Yonkers, where they have an enclosed yard perfect for playing and training.  They have three miniature schanzuers who are on the wild side.  It will definitely be good training on how to deal with less well-behaved dogs!  I have lots of friends in my UES neighborhood and in the building who have dogs.  They have all offered to have the pup over and introduce him to their pets.  We also have an enclosed playground outside the building where the dogs can play in a safe space.    I also enjoy traveling and plan on taking the puppy with me.  Normally I tend to travel abroad but while I’m raising the puppy I hope to learn more about places that are closer to home!  The pup will come with me in the car and we already have a one or two week trip planned to North Carolina via Washington, DC in late April.  My friends are looking forward to meeting the pup and I’m sure it’ll be a good experience for everyone."

The pup will come with me in the car and we already have a one or two week trip planned to North Carolina via Washington, DC in late April.  My friends are looking forward to meeting the pup and I’m sure it’ll be a good experience for everyone."

Even with all of her initial issues, she has continued to demonstrate that she can learn.  Please note that the introduction of a prong collar has made a significant difference in dealing with her issues, such as, pulling. Bethanne is a well behaved puppy with the prong collar, not so well behaved without it.

She is excellent on the metro and will wiggle herself directly under my chair and basically fall asleep until it's time to go. She has gone to a noisey pub, it took her 10-15min to settle down but she was quiet and under the table for 1.5 hours. We headed out in time for elimination. She rides beautifully in the car. We went to a dance concert and, again,l it took her 10-15min to settle but once she did she was fine for about 45min. We did not stay in the theater for the second half of the show as she gave a slight yelp of boredom. But we did stay in the lobby contented to wait for our party to exit the theater. Afterwards she settles directly in the car and slept until we got back home. Every outing seemed to have worn her out but once she gets home she is very excited to play with her doggy housemate. Once it is time to go to bed she will settle right down and kennel wonderfully. ",,,,,26,,,,

Our lifestyle: Tony (my husband) runs the Jamestown 4-H Center. We live about 30 minutes away and will occasionally spend days there and have the opportunity to interact with all kinds of people and participate in a lot of activities. I am home with our four children that we homeschool. Our children's ages are 8yrs, 7yrs, 5yrs, and 3yrs.  Since we homeschool we are home a lot. We have a nice sized, fenced-in backyard that the kids spend a lot of time in. Three of our children LOVE dogs. We had our own dogs, but in the past year have had to put both of them down. Our kids are the kind who will lay on the floor petting and loving on the dog. I would prefer a dog with a more calm temperament.  We live on the end of a cul-de-sac in a small town. It's fairly quiet with little to no traffic.. Several of our neighbors have dogs.   Weekends we go to church on Sunday and do AWANA. It's probably the day we are out the most.  During the weekday afternoons we tend to be running around to piano lessons, woodworking class, homeschool group, bible study. We would like to think that we could bring the pup (once they get a little older to many of these things) I have already received some permissions.    We have been in this area for 4.5yrs and don't have any plans on moving any time soon. We have family in NJ and try to travel there about once every 8 weeks or so. We also have a pop-up camper and try to go camping at least one weekend each month. We are hoping that it is OK to take our pup with us for these trips?  Our dogs have always just traveled with us everywhere.  I guess we would also request a pup that doesn't mind being in the car because we are about 30 mins from just about everything, and it will be over an hour drive to get to our GEB class each week.  We have been prepping our kids for some time about getting a GEB pup.    We began about 10 months ago with reading some books; like Follow My Leader and Through Otis' Eyes. Watching documentaries, etc...  As far as exercising; I will be walking our dog each morning, playing in the yard with the kids (like hide & seek and fetch), and my husband usually does shorter evening walks and running/biking on the weekends.  If we can avoid a dog with a strong prey drive/ a chaser, that would help me with the kids in the yard as they tend to run around a ton.  That's all I can think of. We are planning on getting our own pup when our GEB pup is about a year old if everything is working out. We are looking at female Golden Retrievers. For our GEB pup we were going to ask if we could have a female shepherd or a female yellow lab. Of course we would be happy to raise any pup that you think is the best match for our family."

Our home is on a quiet cul-de-sac with sidewalks.  Most of the houses are on 1/3-1/2 acre lots.  Our backyard is fenced in with lots of birds and squirrels.  We are just steps from the Raleigh Greenway, which provides miles of paved walking trails.      Our lifestyle is rather laid back.  Gail is a retired English teacher.  She works 9-2 Monday-Thursday at a church downtown.  She is 10 minutes from home.  She exercises regularly at the gym.  However, with a puppy she would make her gym membership inactive and change her exercise program to walking (and working/playing) with the dog in the afternoons.  There is also adequate time for the pup before we leave for work.  Gail also enjoys working outside.     David works full-time at the Secretary of State’s office downtown.  He is usually away from home on weekdays from 7:30-5:30.  He is very active on the weekends and on afternoons playing disc golf.      Together we have four sons.  None live at home.  There are no grandchildren…only the children in the neighborhood.    We are usually home on the weekends.  We are hardly ever away overnight.  If we are away, it is for short periods only…going to church, visiting Grandmother, for instance.  We are home almost every evening with the exception of choir rehearsal (Gail) or occasion meeting or movie.       All the years we had dogs, we thought, “When the dogs are gone, we’ll be able to do [this or that] or travel.”  However, over the past 2 years we have noticed that our lifestyle did not change.  We just love to be around home.      Our health is good and we are active.  The opportunity to raise a Guiding Eye pup will be good for us and good for the pup.  We want the activity and joy that a dog brings to a home, but we do not want the extreme sadness that goes along with raising a dog to old age only to grieve when it dies as our beagles did.  But we believe that we can be really good “foster parents.”  Yes, seeing the pup leave us will be hard, but this dog’s purpose is not to be our life-long companion.  This dog has a greater purpose, a higher calling.      The son of one of our friends lost his sight as a teenager to a brain tumor several years ago.  He has become amazingly independent.   He leaves next week for New Jersey to meet his new dog and to learn how his life will change with his new companion.  We are so thrilled for him.  His family and friends are so grateful to the people who made this possible for him.      We believe that we can offer a pup a good home and a good foundation in order to help someone who deserves a more independent life."

For me, this means that I am in class 12 hours a week (3 four-hour classes: 2 on Monday 9-12 and 1-4 and one Thurs 1-4) and intern at Albany Medical Center for 8 hours a day, two days a week. On the days I am interning, I do get an hour break for lunch and could easily come home to let the dog out during this time. As for work, I work Monday nights from 5:30-8PM, but just about all other times I am at home or running an occasional errand. Fortunately, though, I will have some support raising this dog. My boyfriend and his roommate will also be helping me and attending classes. The puppy will be living mostly at their apartment which is the entire second floor of a house and has a small non-enclosed backyard. Sometimes, though, the puppy will be at my house when the boys are not home or have gone somewhere over night. My apartment is a block away from their's and is the second and third floor of a house. I have two roommates who are aware of my decision to raise a puppy and are on board to learn how to help me teach him good house manners and adhere to Guiding Eye training policies. Our landlords and the other tenants living below me and my boyfriend's apartments are also close friends and aware with and fine with us raising a puppy in our apartments. Both of our apartments are in Albany, and we do both have neighboring houses very close to the vicinity of ours. On some weekends, (about once every 6 weeks), we travel home to Long Island and have considered how this might affect us being able to raise a puppy. We have thought about and worked out a plan (according to the advice we have received from Guiding Eyes) to transport the puppy when we do this and for a place for the puppy to stay when we get there. My parents have agreed to let the puppy stay at my house while we are home and are excited to also take part in teaching him good house manners and socialization. While at my house on Long Island, I have a large enclosed yard which I hope to utilize to let the puppy have some free space to run and get active. My family does have another dog at home, however, this dog is a Shiba Inu and has been exposed to a number of other dogs coming to my house (cousin's dogs) without their ever being a problem. Our Shiba Inu always has to stay on a leash when outside due to their hunting nature and tendency to run. As for other weekends, when we are not traveling home. My boyfriend and I are pretty much always at his apartment or not very far. Our weekends are pretty low-key at this point and provide us with ample time to socialize the dog and get out to new places and settings. Finally, as far as upcoming events, we plan on traveling home to Long Island for our winter break which will be about 4 weeks in December. We have discussed with our RM possibly attending classes at the Guiding Eyes Center in NYC at this time, if this can be arranged, so that we do not miss out on classes. We would be more than willing to travel there to attend classes and are hoping this will work. If not though, we will work on arranging something to get back to the area for the nights that classes are held, or at least the majority of them (we may have to miss just one if that is the case). Other than that, we do plan on graduating in May and leaving the area to return home to Long Island. This may leave us only able to raise a puppy until May, however, depending on how things go and how much time we find needed to raise the puppy and what kind of  feasible plan we are able to work out, we are considering the possibility of also keeping the puppy after May and transferring to the NYC Guiding Eyes Center, as we recently have been told we may be able to do.     We are, with the support of our roommates and families, excited to raise a puppy for Guiding Eyes! If you need any further information about our situation or I was unclear about anything, PLEASE let us know! Thank you so much for this opportunity!"

Whenever I get frustrated with him I try and think about how she was when I got her and to how she behaved when I took her to NY.    I was disappointed in the lack of information I recieved about him beforehand though. If I had been told about his bad habits (peeing in the house, garbage diving, energy level, stubbornness etc.) I can't say I would have agreed to take him.

Currently, 2 still live at home and 1 of those 2 goes to college. The other works 2 jobs, but she is home every night to sleep. Our other daughter lives out of state and comes home to visit during holidays and long weekends. We have 2 cats that have been exposed to the neighbor’s dogs, so they are getting used to having a dog around. My husband and I work during the week—he goes to work at 5:30 and I leave for work at 7:15. He is usually home around 4, but only works 4 days of the week. I get home around 5:30 and work 5 days a week. On Saturdays we go to puppy class in the morning, and then the rest of the day is open to whatever may be planned. Sundays we go to church in the morning then grocery shop around noon. We eat family dinner when the kids get home from work, usually around 5 or 6. Our daughter will invite friends over to watch TV in the evening. My husband and I are usually in bed by 11 every night. The cats sleep with our daughter but roam the house during the day and evening. I do work from home about one day a week but not every week. Monday nights during the fall and spring I bowl. Tuesday nights we have choir practice for an hour. Thursday nights we attend Weight Watcher meetings for an hour. We have season tickets to SU basketball games. We live in a suburb of Syracuse on a quiet street. We are friends with the neighbors who are very supportive. I'm still waiting to hear from my supervisor if HR will allow me to bring the puppy to work. Once I get the ok from everyone that will be my daily plan. Our daughter doesn’t go to work until later in the morning or early afternoon, so taking the puppy out will not be a problem. If she has to work early, my neighbor who is a puppy raiser said she will come let the puppy out. My husband and I do have a gym membership and we go about 2 evenings a week for about an hour each time. We sound very busy but we have a lot of time to relax too. With the exception of my work, the puppy would be involved in everything I do but limited on what my husband does as he would not be taking the puppy to work--he works in a warehouse with semi trucks and other equipment that he would not be able to maintain control of a dog while doing his job. I work as a computer tech support person in a business office, so I have more opportunity for teaching moments that would be safe for the puppy."

I live alone, so the environment is quiet and calm. I have very good neighbors who in a pinch could get the dog out for a walk if I wasn't able to return in the appropriate time frame that the dog needed to maintain its routine.  I have a daughter who lives 3/4 mi. from me. She is not interested in accepting responsibility to the ""puppy raising"", but has assured me she would like to be able to take the dog for occasional walks and would be available to take the dog on a weekend if I needed help.  I am no longer employed outside the home. I see a few clients each week in my home. The time I would spend with a client does not exceed the time the pup can be caged. The work I do is as a massage therapist. Contact and touch is a comfortable way I respond with people or animals.  I am a physically  active person. Looking forward to having company on many of my walks.  My mother who lives in Arlington Virginia I try to visit about once every six weeks. My visit is usually about 4 days. The next time I plan to visit her is July 19 - 23. It will be a family reunion so I will either need a foster volunteer to be with the dog, or to be able to have the dog with me on the train (amtrac) or bus. The dog has been invited.  I have a lot of time on my hands that I haven't yet figured out how to use well. i retired from full time work August 2011 and have been in search of a volunteer job I would find rewarding and educating. I feel this job will offer me the involvement that I want to embrace at this time in my life."

I am waiting to find a job in a church as a worship leader so that will be a change once I get a job.
